They possessed fifty :méiarisia. One day, the husband said to his wife: ‘Let us lend out that moncy and get some advantage from it, for in drawing on it a little at a time, we are going to spend it all’. The wife answered: ‘If you insist on lending this moncy, come: lend it to the God of the Christians’. He said to her: ‘Well, where is this God of the Chris- tians, so we can lend it to him”? She said: ‘I will show you. Not only shal] you not lose your money, but it shall even earn interest for you and the capital shall be doubled.’ He said to her: ‘Come on&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;then; show me him and we will lend to him’. She took her husband and Jed him to the most holy church, Now the church at Nisbis has five large doorways. As she brought him to the entrance, there where the great porches are, she showed him the poor and said: ‘If you give to these persons, the God of the Christians receives it, for these are all his’. Immediately, and with gladness, he gave the fifty miliarisia to the poor, and went back to his house. Three months later, their expenses exceeded their ability to pay. The man said to his wife: ‘Sister, the God if the Christians is not going to pay us back anything of that debt and, here we are, in need’, In reply, the woman said: ‘Yes, he will repay. Go to where you handed over the money and he will return it to you right away.’ He went off to the holy church at a run. When he came to the spot where he had given the miliarisia to the poor, he went all around the church, expecting to find somebody who would give back to him what was owing to him. But all he found was the poor, still sitting there. While he was trying to decide to which of them to speak or whom he should ask, he saw at his feet, on the marble floor, one large niliarision ying there, one of those which he himself had distributed to his brothers the poor. Bending down, he picked it up and went to his house, Then he said to his spouse: ‘Look, I just went to your church and, believe me, woman, I did not see the God of the Christians as you said I would. And he certainly did not give me anything, except that I found this miliarision lying there where I gave fifty of them away.’ Then that wondrous woman said to him: ‘Tt is he who invisibly provided that miliarision, for he is invisible and he operates the universe with invisible power and an unseen hand. Now, go, sir; buy us something so we can eat today, and he will provide you with something else.’ Off he went and bought bread, wine and fish for them. He came back and gave his purchases to his wife. She took the fish and began to clean it. When she cut it open, she found within a stone so magnificent that she was struck with wonder at it. She had no idea what it was, but&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;she kept it nevertheless, When ber husband came, she showed him whilst they were eating the stone she had found and said: ‘Look, I found this stone inside the fish’. When he saw it, he too was amazed at its beauty, but he did not know what it really was. When they had finished eating, he said to her: ‘Give it to me; I will go and sell it, if I can find a way of getting anything for it’. As I said, he did not know what it was, for he was a simple man. He took the stone and went to the money-changer; he was also a silver-smith. It was time for the smith to go home (for it was evening,) but the man said to him: ‘Would you like to buy this stone?” When the money- changer saw it, he said: ‘How much do you want for it?” The man said: ‘Give me what you will’, The other replied: “Take five .miliarisia for it then’. Thinking that the merchant was making fun of him, the man said: ‘Would you give that much for it?’ The merchant thought the man was being sarcastic, so he said: ‘Well, take ten miliarisia for it then’, Still thinking that the merchant was making fun of him, the man remained silent, at which the other said: ‘Then take twenty s/liarisia for it’. As the man still kept silent and made no response, the merchant raised his offer to thirty, and then to fifty «/liarisia, swearing that he would indeed pay that much. The seller of the stone realised that it must be very valuable if the merchant were prepared to pay fifty ani/iarisia for it. Little by little the merchant raised his offer until it reached three hundred large miliarisia. This sum the man accepted. He handed over the stone and went home to his wife with a glad heart. When she saw him, she asked him how much he had sold it for, expecting him to say five or ten pholleis, He took out the three-lundred siliarisia and handed them to her, saying that for so much he had sold the stone. Filled with wonder at the goodness of God, she said to him: ‘Oh husband, see how good and generous and affluent is the God of the Christians! Look how he has not merely returned to you the fifty mliarisia you lent him together with interest, but in only a few days has given you the capital multiplied by six! Know therefore&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;that there is no other God, neither on earth nor in heaven, but him alone.’ Convinced by this miracle and learning the truth by experi- ence, he immediately became a Christian and glorified our God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, gratefully acknowledging the intelligence of his wife by which it had been granted to him to know God in very truth,&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;]]]]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^Z&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]\\n \\nOn the island of Samos, Mary, the friend of both God and the poor, the mother of Master Paul, the military official attached to the court kandidatos, told us that there was a christian woman in Nisbis whose husband was a pagan Hellén.

Immediately, and with gladness, he gave the fifty miliarisia to the poor, and went back to his house. Three months later, their expenses exceeded their ability to pay. The man said to his wife: ‘Sister, the God if the Christians is not going to pay us back anything of that debt and, here we are, in need’, In reply, the woman said: ‘Yes, he will repay. Go to where you handed over the money and he will return it to you right away.’ He went off to the holy church at a run. When he came to the spot where he had given the miliarisia to the poor, he went all around the church, expecting to find somebody who would give back to him what was owing to him. But all he found was the poor, still sitting there. While he was trying to decide to which of them to speak or whom he should ask, he saw at his feet, on the marble floor, one large niliarision \\\\ying there, one of those which he himself had distributed to his brothers the poor. Bending down, he picked it up and went to his house, Then he said to his spouse: ‘Look, I just went to your church and, believe me, woman, I did not see the God of the Christians as you said I would. And he certainly did not give me anything, except that I found this miliarision lying there where I gave fifty of them away.’ Then that wondrous woman said to him: ‘Tt is he who invisibly provided that miliarision, for he is invisible and he operates the universe with invisible power and an unseen hand. Now, go, sir; buy us something so we can eat today, and he will provide you with something else.’ Off he went and bought bread, wine and fish for them. He came back and gave his purchases to his wife. She took the fish and began to clean it. When she cut it open, she found within a stone so magnificent that she was struck with wonder at it. She had no idea what it was, but  \\n \\nshe kept it nevertheless, When ber husband came, she showed him whilst they were eating the stone she had found and said: ‘Look, I found this stone inside the fish’. When he saw it, he too was amazed at its beauty, but he did not know what it really was. When they had finished eating, he said to her: ‘Give it to me; I will go and sell it, if I can find a way of getting anything for it’. As I said, he did not know what it was, for he was a simple man. He took the stone and went to the money-changer; he was also a silver-smith. It was time for the smith to go home (for it was evening,) but the man said to him: ‘Would you like to buy this stone?” When the money- changer saw it, he said: ‘How much do you want for it?” The man said: ‘Give me what you will’, The other replied: “Take five .miliarisia for it then’. Thinking that the merchant was making fun of him, the man said: ‘Would you give that much for it?’ The merchant thought the man was being sarcastic, so he said: ‘Well, take ten miliarisia for it then’, Still thinking that the merchant was making fun of him, the man remained silent, at which the other said: ‘Then take twenty s/liarisia for it’. As the man still kept silent and made no response, the merchant raised his offer to thirty, and then to fifty «/liarisia, swearing that he would indeed pay that much. The seller of the stone realised that it must be very valuable if the merchant were prepared to pay fifty ani/iarisia for it. Little by little the merchant raised his offer until it reached three hundred large miliarisia. This sum the man accepted. He handed over the stone and went home to his wife with a glad heart. When she saw him, she asked him how much he had sold it for, expecting him to say five or ten pholleis, He took out the three-lundred siliarisia and handed them to her, saying that for so much he had sold the stone. Filled with wonder at the goodness of God, she said to him: ‘Oh husband, see how good and generous and affluent is the God of the Christians! Look how he has not merely returned to you the fifty mliarisia you lent him together with interest, but in only a few days has given you the capital multiplied by six! Know therefore  \\n \\nthat there is no other God, neither on earth nor in heaven, but him alone.’ Convinced by this miracle and learning the truth by experi- ence, he immediately became a Christian and glorified our God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, gratefully acknowledging the intelligence of his wife by which it had been granted to him to know God in very truth,\\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^1:&quot;,22,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^K&quot;,280,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,5653],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^16&quot;,280,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^12&quot;,280,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^11&quot;,280,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[806,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef3909-4574-4c6a-b0d7-a86604333850&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[807,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;This same father of ours, George the archimandrite, also told us about Abba Julian who became bishop of Bostra: that after he left the community and became bishop of Bostra, certain affluent citizens who were enemies of Christ wanted to do away with him by poison.

When we were there, the residents told us that this Saint Gerasimos was walking one day by the banks of the holy Jordan when he met a lion, roaring mightily with pain in its paw. The point of a reed was deeply embedded in it, causing inflammation and suppuration. ‘When the lion saw the elder, it came to him and showed him the foot, wounded by the point embedded in it, whimpering and begging some healing of him. When the elder saw the lion in such distress, he sat down and, taking the paw, he lanced it. The point was removed, and also much puss. He cleansed the wound well, bound it up and dismissed the beast. But the healed lion would not leave the elder. It followed him like a noble disciple wherever he went.

The fathers used to hand the ass over to the lion, to pasture it on the banks of the Jordan. One day when the ass was being pastured by the lion, it went away some distance from its keeper. Some camel-drivers on their way from Arabia found the ass and took it away to their country. Having lost the ass, the lion came back to the lavra and approached Abba Gerasimos, very downcast and dismayed. The abba thought that the lion had devoured the ass. He said to it: ‘Where is the ass\\&quot;? The beast stood silent, hanging its head, very much like a man. The elder said to it: ‘Have you eaten it? Blessed be God!

Sometime after the release of the lion, the camel-driver who had taken the ass came back to the Holy City to sell grain and he had the ass with him. Having crossed the holy Jordan, he chanced to find himself face to face with the lion. When he saw the beast, he left his camels and took to his heels. Recognising the ass, the lion Tan to it, seized its leading rein_in its mouth (as it had been accustomed to do) and led away, not only the ass, but also the three camels, It brought then to the elder, rejoicing and roaring at having found the ass which it had lost.

The brother persisted, saying: ‘If 1 am to remain here, that is where lam going to stay’. Then the priest said: ‘On your own head be it: go and stay there’. The brother went and stayed there for a week and, when the holy day of the Lord came round, he came to the church. The priest was relieved to sce him. The following Sunday he did not come to the church, so the priest summoned two brothers to go and find out why he was not present in church. They went to the cell and found that the brother had put a rope around his neck and strangled himself. \\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^1:&quot;,36,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^K&quot;,410,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,1266],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^16&quot;,410,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^12&quot;,410,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^11&quot;,410,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[830,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef3909-5a9b-4c2a-883f-c9af9015a146&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[831,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Some of the fathers told us about Abba George (Gregory) the anchorite who for thirty-five years travelled around naked in the wilderness.

The elder blessed him and brother Thelalaios remained with him for two and a half years; then he perceived that his end was near.

I went and&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;spoke with him and he showed me a copy of the New Testament-&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;written on extremely fine skins. I asked him how much it was and he told me: ‘Three pieces of gold’, But then he added: ‘Is it you yourself who wants to buy it, or somebody else?’ I said: ‘believe me, father, it is an anchorite who wants it’. Then Abba Peter said to me: ‘If the anchorite wants it, take it to him graciS, Here too are three pieces of gold. If he does not like the book, there are the three pieces of gold; buy him what he wants’. I took up the book and brought it to the anchorite. He took it and went off into the wilderness. Two months later the anchorite returned and came to my cell saying: ‘You know, Abba John, the thought troubles me that I got the book for nothing’. I told“him not to worry; that Abba Peter was rich and good and that he was pleased to have done what he had done. But the anchorite replied: ‘I will get no rest until I have given him the price’, I asked him if he had anything to pay with and he answered: ‘No, nothing at all, but give me a rough tunic to wear’ (for he was naked). I gave him the tunic and an old cloak and he went and worked on the reservoir which the Patriarch of Jerusalem (whose name was John) was constructing at Sinai. He received five copper coins pholleis a day so he came and stayed? near me at the Lavra of the A3liotes. He ate no more than ten lupin seeds a day and yet he worked all the day long. When he had saved up three pieces of gold out of the coppers he earned, he said to me: ‘Take the money and give it to him.

I went and  \\n \\nspoke with him and he showed me a copy of the New Testament-  \\n \\nwritten on extremely fine skins. I asked him how much it was and he told me: ‘Three pieces of gold’, But then he added: ‘Is it you yourself who wants to buy it, or somebody else?’ I said: ‘believe me, father, it is an anchorite who wants it’. Then Abba Peter said to me: ‘If the anchorite wants it, take it to him graciS, Here too are three pieces of gold. If he does not like the book, there are the three pieces of gold; buy him what he wants’. I took up the book and brought it to the anchorite. He took it and went off into the wilderness. Two months later the anchorite returned and came to my cell saying: ‘You know, Abba John, the thought troubles me that I got the book for nothing’. I told“him not to worry; that Abba Peter was rich and good and that he was pleased to have done what he had done. But the anchorite replied: ‘I will get no rest until I have given him the price’, I asked him if he had anything to pay with and he answered: ‘No, nothing at all, but give me a rough tunic to wear’ (for he was naked). I gave him the tunic and an old cloak and he went and worked on the reservoir which the Patriarch of Jerusalem (whose name was John) was constructing at Sinai. He received five copper coins pholleis a day so he came and stayed? near me at the Lavra of the A3liotes. He ate no more than ten lupin seeds a day and yet he worked all the day long. When he had saved up three pieces of gold out of the coppers he earned, he said to me: ‘Take the money and give it to him. If he will not accept  \\n \\nit, give him back the book.’ I went off and told this to Abba Peter, but he would accept neither the book nor the price of it. I did, however, prevail on him to accept the price and not to disdain the anchorite’s labour. He took the money, whilst I went back and gave the book to the anchorite—who went off into the wilderness

When Thalilaios hoped to continue the evil he had previously committed by the unjust intervention of those in authority, the angel who governed the Thesslonican church set out together with the great martyr Demetrios, And in the very place where he used to associate with the impure demon which provoked him and to contrive his onslaughts against the holy church of God; there, in that place, he nailed the unhallowed body of him, the unprofitable servant, and lifted up into the air those feet which would not walk in the way of righteousness, bearing the marks which indicated the judgement which awaited him; and that Jt is a terrible thing to fall into the Aands of the living God Heb 10:31. \\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^1:&quot;,53,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^K&quot;,511,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,2687],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^16&quot;,511,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^12&quot;,511,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^11&quot;,511,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[897,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef3909-e17e-4dc8-a8f1-322933cc6dcf&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[898,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;When we were going from holy Gethsemane to the Mount of Olives, we came to a monastery known as Abba Abraham&apos;s which was founded by Abraham the Great (of the New Church of the all- glorious Mother of God, the ever-virgin Mary) who became higoumen there after Eudoxios.

There I met a great elder named Christopher, a Roman by race. One day I prostrated myself before him and said: ‘Of your charity, abba, tell me how you have spent your life from youth up’. As I persisted in my request and because he knew I was making it for the benefit of my soul, he told me, saying: When I renounced the world, child, I was full of ardour for the monastic way of life. By day I would carefully observe the rule of prayer; and at night I would go to pray in the cave where the saintly Theodosios and the other holy fathers were buried. As I went down into the cave, I would make a hundred prostrations to Gad at each step: there were eighteen steps. Having gone down all the steps, I would stay there until they struck the wood-en signal for matins, at which time I would come back up for the regular office. After ten years spent in that way, with fastings and continence and physical labour, one night I came as usual to go down into the cave. After I had performed my prostrations on each step, as I was about to set foot on the floor of the cave, I fell into a trance. I saw the entire floor of the cave covered with lamps, some of which were lit and some were not. I also saw two men, wearing mantles and clothed in white, who tended those lamps. I asked them why they had set those lamps out in such a way that we could not go down and pray. They replied: ‘These are the lamps of the fathers’. I spoke to them again: “Why are some of them lit while others are not’? Again they answered me: ‘Those who wished to do so lit their own lamps’. Then I said to them: ‘Of your charity, tell me: is my lamp lit or not? ‘Pray’, they said, ‘and we will light it’. ‘Pray? I immediately retorted, ‘and what have I been doing until now?’ With these words I returned to my senses and, when I turned round, there was not a person to be seen. Then I said to myself: ‘Christopher, if you want to be saved, then yet greater effort is required’. At dawn I left the monastery and went to Mount Sinai. I had nothing with me but the clothes I stood up in. After I had spent fifty years of monastic endeavour there, a voice came to me saying: ‘Christopher, Christopher, go back to your community in which you fought the good fight, so that you may die with your fathers’. And a little while after he told me this, bis holy soul went joyfully to rest in the Lord. Again, the same Abba Theodoulos told us about this Abba Christopher. According to him, the elder said: ‘One day I went up from the monastery to the Holy City to venerate the Holy Cross. After I had performed my devotions, as I was coming out of the ante-chamber of the Holy Cross, I saw a brother standing at the door, neither going in nor coming out. I also saw two ugly crows flying in his face and brushing their wings against his eyes, effective- ly preventing him from entering the shrine. Knowing them to be demons, I said to him: “Tell me, brother, why do you hesitate in the doorway itself and not go in”? He said: “Forgive me, abba; I have conflicting emotions, sir. One urges me to enter and to venerate the honourable Cross, but the other says: “No; make an excuse and make your devotions some other time’”, When I heard this, I took him by the hand and led him into the shrine; the crows immediately fled from him. I got him to venerate the Holy Cross and the Holy Sepulchre of Christ our God, then I dismissed him in peace.

The wind stood well for each of them, but we alone could make no headway. We remained stuck in the same place for fifteen days, not moving at all from where we lay.

One day there came to me a voice of no visible origin saying: ‘Throw Mary out and you will make good way’. As I delayed, trying to work out what this meant and who Mary might be, the voice came to me again: ‘I told you: throw Mary out and you will be safe’. Then I devised the following procedure. I shouted out: “Mary!’—for I had no idea who Mary was. She, however, was lying in her bunk; and she responded, saying: ‘Why are you calling, sir?’ Then I said to her: ‘Would you please be so kind as to come here?’ She got up and came, When she arrived, I took her aside and said to her: ‘Sister Mary, you see how great my sins are and that because of me you are all going to perish?’ She heaved a deep sigh and said: ‘Oh Shipmaster, sir; in fact it is I who am the sinner’, I said to her: ‘Woman, what sins have you committed?’ She said: ‘I think there is no sin which I have not committed; and because of my sins, everybody is going to perish’. Then {said the shipmaster) the woman said something like this to me: ‘In fact, Shipmaster, wretch that I am sir, I had a husband and two children of his fathering. When one of the children was nine years old and the other five, my husband died and I was left a widow. There was a soldier living near me who wished to take me for his wife and I sent some people to talk to him. The soldier said he would not take a wife who had children by another man with her. When I learned that he did not want to take me on account of the children, and also because I was very much in love with him, wretch that I am, I slew the children and said to him: “See, now I have none”. When he heard what I had done with the children, he said: “As the Lord lives who dwells in heaven, I will not have her”, In my fear that it might become known what I had done and I lose my life, I fled’. Even when I heard this from the woman, I still did not want to throw her into the sea just like that. So I equivocated (he said) and told her: ‘Look, I will get into the dinghy and if the vessel then makes way, know, woman, that it is my sins which are at work in this ship. Then (he said) he called for the dinghy and ordered it to be launched. But when he got into it, neither ship nor dinghy made any more headway than before. So he came back on board and said to the woman: ‘You get down into the dinghy’. She did; and as soon as she set foot in the dinghy, it turned round about five times and then sank to the bottom of the deep.

The girl was unbaptised at the time of her bereavement. One day she went apart into the garden which her parents had left her (for there are gardens in the middle of the city, in the houses of the great ones). Whilst she was in the garden, she saw a man preparing to hang himself. She rushed to him and said: ‘What are you doing, good man?’ He said to her: ‘Look, leave me alone woman, for I am in&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;great affliction’. The maiden said to him; ‘Tell me the truth, for perhaps I may be able to help you’. He told her: ‘I am heavily in debt and my creditors are putting pressure on me to repay them. I have chosen to die rather than to lead such a woeful existence.’ The maiden said to him: ‘I beg of you, take whatever I have and give it to them; only please do not destroy yourself. He took what she offered and paid off his debts. Then the girl began to run into difficulties, Having no one to look after her (because she had been deprived of her parents) and being in great need, she began to prostitute herself. Some people who knew her, and knew the standing which her parents had enjoyed in society, said: ‘Who knows the judgements of God or why he allows a soul to fall for some reason or other?’ The some time later, the girl fell ill—and came back to her senses. Consumed with remorse, she said to her neighbours: ‘For the sake of the Lord, have mercy on my soul; speak to the pope about making me a Christian’. But they all laughed at her and said: ‘As if he would accept this woman who is a prostitute!’ This caused her great distress. Whilst she was in this condition and very frustrated, an angel of the Lord stood by her—in the form of the man on whom she had compassion. He said to her: ‘What is the trouble?\\&quot; She replied: ‘I desire to become a Christian and nobody will stand up for me’. He said: ‘Do you really want this?’ She replied: ‘Yes, I beg of you’. He said to her: ‘Take courage; I will get some people to take you to church’. He brought two others who were also angels and they carried her to the church. Then they transformed themselves into illustrious personages with the rank of prefect. They summoned the clergy charged with the responsibility for baptisms, and these asked: ‘Your Charity will vouch for her? They answered: ‘Yes’. Then the clergy did what was called for in the service for those who are about to be baptised; then they baptised her in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and they vested her in the garment of the neophyte. Clothed in white, she returned home carried by the angels, who set&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;her down and promptly disappeared. When the neighbours saw her all in white, they said to her: ‘Who baptised you?’—and she told them of those who had taken her to church, how they had spoken to the clergy and how the clergy had baptised her. They asked her who those people were; to which the woman would give no answer. So they went and reported the matter to the pope. He summoned those in charge of the baptistry and said to them: ‘Did you baptise that woman?’ They admitted that they had baptised her, adding that she had been vouched for by so-and-so of prefectorial rank, The bishop sent for those whom they had named and enquired of them whether they had vouched for her. They said: “We are not aware of having done so, nor do we know anybody else who has’. Then the bishop realised that this was divine business. He sum- moned the woman and said: ‘Tell me, daughter, what good have you done?’ She said: ‘I am a prostitute and a poor woman too; what good could I do?’ He said to her: ‘Are you not aware of ever having done any good deed at all?’ She said: ‘No. Except that I once saw a man about to hang himself because he was being harassed by his creditors. I gave him my entire fortune and freed him of his debt.’ She said this, and fell asleep in the Lord, released from both her voluntary and her involuntary deeds of sin.

Then the clergy did what was called for in the service for those who are about to be baptised; then they baptised her in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and they vested her in the garment of the neophyte. Clothed in white, she returned home carried by the angels, who set  \\n \\nher down and promptly disappeared. When the neighbours saw her all in white, they said to her: ‘Who baptised you?’—and she told them of those who had taken her to church, how they had spoken to the clergy and how the clergy had baptised her. They asked her who those people were; to which the woman would give no answer. So they went and reported the matter to the pope. He summoned those in charge of the baptistry and said to them: ‘Did you baptise that woman?’ They admitted that they had baptised her, adding that she had been vouched for by so-and-so of prefectorial rank, The bishop sent for those whom they had named and enquired of them whether they had vouched for her. They said: “We are not aware of having done so, nor do we know anybody else who has’. Then the bishop realised that this was divine business. He sum- moned the woman and said: ‘Tell me, daughter, what good have you done?’ She said: ‘I am a prostitute and a poor woman too; what good could I do?’ He said to her: ‘Are you not aware of ever having done any good deed at all?’ She said: ‘No. Except that I once saw a man about to hang himself because he was being harassed by his creditors. I gave him my entire fortune and freed him of his debt.’ She said this, and fell asleep in the Lord, released from both her voluntary and her involuntary deeds of sin. Then the bishop glorified God and said: Righteous you are O God, and upright are your judgements Ps 118:137.\\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^1:&quot;,87,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^K&quot;,401,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,4296],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^16&quot;,401,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^12&quot;,401,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^11&quot;,401,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1064,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390a-2114-4951-bf30-f822dfb1d205&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1065,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;One of the fathers told us that the blessed Ephraim, Patriarch of Antioch,” had a great deal of zeal and fervour for the orthodox faith.

When the blessed Gregory heard it, he excluded the brother from communion because he had contravened the rule of the monastery. A little while Jater, the excluded brother died and the pope did not Jearn about it. Two or three days later the higoumen came and reported to him that the brother had gone to his rest. The pope was grieved at this in no small way—for not having absolved the brother of the punishment of exclusion before he departed this life. So the pope wrote a prayer on a tablet and gave it to one of the archdeacons, He told him to go and read it over the brother. It was a prayer absolving the dead man from exclusion.

Of your charity, buy me .one.’ The brother in secular life said to him: ‘Here are three pieces of gold; take them and buy yourself whatever you like.’ The monk took the three pieces of gold, then went and reported it to his higoumen, who, when he heard it, went and reported it to the most holy pope. When the blessed Gregory heard it, he excluded the brother from communion because he had contravened the rule of the monastery. A little while Jater, the excluded brother died and the pope did not Jearn about it. Two or three days later the higoumen came and reported to him that the brother had gone to his rest. The pope was grieved at this in no small way—for not having absolved the brother of the punishment of exclusion before he departed this life. So the pope wrote a prayer on a tablet and gave it to one of the archdeacons, He told him to go and read it over the brother. It was a prayer absolving the dead man from exclusion. The archdeacon went as he was commanded and read the letter containing the prayer over the brother. That same night the higoumen saw the dead brother. The higoumen said to him: ‘Are you not dead, brother?’ and he said: ‘Yes, indeed’. Then the abba asked him again: ‘Where were you until today?’ The brother said to him: ‘Truly, sir, I was in prison and I was not set free until yesterday’. Thus everybody knew that he was absolved of his  \\n \\nexclusion in the very same hour at which the archdeacon said the prayer over the grave, and that his soul had been delivered from  \\n \\ncondemnation.\\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^1:&quot;,92,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^K&quot;,479,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,1943],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^16&quot;,479,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^12&quot;,479,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^11&quot;,479,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1070,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390a-58f4-409f-b77f-a1d937a5d046&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1071,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;There was an anchorite in the area of the holy Jordan, Theodore by name, who was a eunuch, He was obliged for some reason or other to go to Constantinople so he boarded a ship.

When he was tortured by the magistrate of Alexandria he said that somebody else had been involved in the murder as his accomplice, a young fellow about twenty years old.

The youth denied having anything to do with the affair, nor had he been with the old fellow. When they had both been severely tortured they were condemned to be hanged. So they went out to the fifth mile-post from the city to where it is customary to punish such criminals. About one stade away there is a ruined temple of Kronos. When they came to the place, the populace and the soldiers wanted to hang the youth on the scaffold first. He made a profound act of obeisance before the soldiers and said: ‘For the sake of the Lord, of your charity hang me towards the east so that I may look in that direction when I am hanging there alone’. The soldiers said to him: ‘Why so”? He replied: ‘In truth, sirs, it is only seven months since your unworthy servant received baptism and became a Christian’. When they heard this, the soldiers wept over the youth. The old fellow called out in great anger: “By Serapis, hang me so I look towards Kronos!’ When the soldiers heard the blasphemy of the old fellow, they left the youth aside and hung the old one. And as they were doing this, a mounted messenger arrived from the prefect and said to the soldiers: ‘Do not execute the youth, bring him back’. This brought joy to all the soldiers who were there. They took him and brought him back into the praetorium, and the prefect released him. Having been rescued when he despaired of rescue, the young man went and became a monk. We have written this for the benefit of the many (and of ourselves, so we might be aware that the Lord knows how to deliver the godly from temptation).&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;]]]]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1085,&quot;^Z&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]\\n \\nAbba Palladios told us that an old fellow living in the world was arrested for murder.

So they went out to the fifth mile-post from the city to where it is customary to punish such criminals. About one stade away there is a ruined temple of Kronos. When they came to the place, the populace and the soldiers wanted to hang the youth on the scaffold first. He made a profound act of obeisance before the soldiers and said: ‘For the sake of the Lord, of your charity hang me towards the east so that I may look in that direction when I am hanging there alone’. The soldiers said to him: ‘Why so”? He replied: ‘In truth, sirs, it is only seven months since your unworthy servant received baptism and became a Christian’. When they heard this, the soldiers wept over the youth. The old fellow called out in great anger: “By Serapis, hang me so I look towards Kronos!’ When the soldiers heard the blasphemy of the old fellow, they left the youth aside and hung the old one. And as they were doing this, a mounted messenger arrived from the prefect and said to the soldiers: ‘Do not execute the youth, bring him back’. This brought joy to all the soldiers who were there. They took him and brought him back into the praetorium, and the prefect released him. Having been rescued when he despaired of rescue, the young man went and became a monk. We have written this for the benefit of the many (and of ourselves, so we might be aware that the Lord knows how to deliver the godly from temptation).\\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1085,&quot;^1:&quot;,95,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1085,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1085,&quot;^K&quot;,526,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1085,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1085,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^

When it came to the point where I had nothing to eat, I resorted to theft. One day, after I had accomplished many deeds of wickedness, I was standing in the market-place and I saw a richly decked-out corpse being taken for burial. I followed the cortége to see where they where going to bury the body. They went behind Saint John’s Church and placed it in a sepulchre; then they went their way. When I saw that everyone had gone, I went into the sepulchre and stripped the corpse of all its clothes—except for a single shroud. As I was leaving the sepulchre (taking a considerable amount of booty with me) my evil habits said to me: “Take the shroud too; it’s worth the trouble”, So, wretch that I am, I turned back and removed the shroud from the corpse, leaving it naked.

I cravenly left all behind and fled from the sepulchre, badly hurt and chilled with horror.

As he was sitting in his cell one Holy Saturday, this Abba George conceived a desire to celebrate the holy resurrection in the Holy City and to partake of the holy mysteries in the Church of the Holy Resurrection of Christ our God. All day long the elder continued in prayer meditating upon the validity of these thoughts. With evening, his disciple came and said: ‘Father, give the word for us to proceed to the canonical service’. The elder replied: ‘You go, and when it is time for holy communion, return home and I will come too. Then the elder stayed in his cell. When it came to the time for holy communion at the Church of the Holy Resurrection, the elder was found near the blessed Bishop Peter and he, together with the priests, was given commu- nion by the bishop. When the patriarch saw him, he said to his syncellos, Menas: ‘When did the abbot abbas of Sinai come here’? The syncellos replied: ‘With all due respect, my lord, I had not seen him until only this very instant’. Then the patriarch said to the syncellos: ‘Tell him not to go away; I want him to take food with me’, The syncellos went and said this to the elder, who responded: ‘The will of God be done’. When the elder had left the service and venerated the holy sepulchre, he found himself back in his cell again, and there was his disciple knocking at the door and saying: ‘Father, if you please, come and communicate’. The elder went to the church with his disciple and partook of the holy mysteries. Archbishop Peter was saddened that the elder should have disobeyed him. After the feast, he sent him a letter; likewise to&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Abba Photios, Bishop of Paran, and to the father of Sinai, telling them to bring the abba to him. When the carrier of the letters arrived and had delivered them, the abba sent three priests to the patriarch: Abba Stephan the Cappadocian, ‘the great’; Abba Zosimos of whom we have spoken above; and Abba Dulcitius, a Roman. The elder sought to justify himself by writing: ‘My most holy lord; God forbid that I should disregard your holy messenger’. Then he wrote this: ‘I would have your blessedness know that, six months from now, we are going to meet each other in the presence of the Lord Christ our God; and there, I will make an act of obeisance to you’. The priests went their way and gave the letter to the patriarch. They said it was many years since the elder had come up to Palestine. They showed him a letter from the Bishop of Paran certifying that for about seventy years the elder had not departed from the holy Mount Sinai. The godly and gentle Peter accepted as witnesses the bishops who were there and the clergy, who said: ‘We saw the elder and we all greeted him with a holy kiss’. Six months later, both the elder and the patriarch died, as the elder had foretold.

One day a kinswoman of mine (and of the most faithful Emperor Maurice came to pray at the Holy City and stayed there for a year. Taking her with me, I went to Saints Cosmas and Damian. While we were in the oratory, I said to my kinswoman: ‘Look, my lady; when an old woman comes distributing two coins to each person, please swallow your pride and accept them’.

When she had gone, we realised that God had revealed to her that I had said: ‘Take them and give them a poor person’. My kinswoman therefore sent a servant of hers to get vegetables with the two coins. These she ate, and she affirmed before God that they were as sweet as honey.

A cloud came over the ship and it rained enough water to satisfy all our needs, It was a great and fearful wonder, for as the ship was borne along by the wind, the cloud followed us; but it did not rain beyond the ship.\\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^1:&quot;,113,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^K&quot;,621,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,1678],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^16&quot;,621,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^12&quot;,621,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^11&quot;,621,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1223,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390a-fb0c-4e90-9ec4-1da1cf0d890a&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1224,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;One of the elders told us that Abba Theodore the Aeliote said that there was a certain recluse on the Mount of Olives, a great warrior against whom the demon of sexual desire waged battle.

The elder began to say to us: ‘Children, the time that remains to us is short. Let us struggle for a little in this world and Jabour, in order that we might have the enjoyment of very great things in eternity. Look at the martyrs, look at the holy men, look at the ascetics; see how courageously they persevered. We will ever wonder at the endurance of those whose remembrances have been preserved from time past. Every one who hears of them acknowledges with great astonishment the spperhusnan endurance of the blessed martyrs; how their eyes were plucked out; how the legs of some of them were cut off, others their hands, whilst some had their feet destroyed. How some were eliminated by raging fire whilst others were slowly roasted. How some were drowned in rivers, others at sea. How some were torn apart by carnivorous beasts like criminals whilst others were fed to birds of prey after suffering exquisite tortures. In brief, if it were possible to describe all the different tortures which were devised for their affliction, everything that the enemy, the devil, has inflicted upon the martyrs and ascetics who loved God, it would be seen how much they endured and how they have wrestled, triumphing over the weakness of the flesh by the courage of the soul. They attained to those good things for which they hoped by counting them more worthy than the trials of this earthly life. This provides a demon- stration of the solid quality of their faith in two ways. On the one hand, that having endured a little, they now enjoy great benefits in eternity. On the other hand, that they so cheerfully endured the physical torments with which the adversary the devil afflicted them. If therefore we endure affliction and persevere, with the help of God, we shall be found to be friends of God indeed. And God will be with us, fighting shoulder to shoulder with us in the battle, greatly alleviating that which we must endure. My children, since we know what kind of times these are and what kind of labour is required of us, let us strive for the self-knowledge which is attained by means of the solitary life. For at this stage it is required of us that we sincerely repent, so that we may indeed be temples of God.

And again: ‘Children, Jet us not Jove the world, neither those things which are in the world’ \\\\ Jn 2:15.

He was from Thessa- lonica, he said, and then he told us this: ‘In my home country, about three stades beyond the city wall, there was a recluse, a native of Mesopotamia whose name was David. He was a man of outstanding virtue, merciful and continent. He spent about twenty years in his place of confinement. Now at this time, because of the barbarians, the walls of the city were patrolled at night by soldiers. One night those who were on guard-duty at that stretch of the city- walls nearest to where the elder’s place of confinement was located, saw fire pouring from the windows of the recluse’s cell. The soldiers thought the barbarians must have set the elder’s cell on fire; but&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;when they went out in the morning, to their amazement, they found the elder unharmed and his cell unburned. Again the following night they saw fire, the same way as before, in the elder’s cell—and this went on for a long time. The occurrence became known to all the city and throughout the countryside. Many people would come and keep vigil at the wall all night long in order to see the fire, which continued to appear until the elder died. As this phenomenon did not merely appear once or twice but was often seen, I said to myself: ‘If God so glorifies his servants in this world, how much more so in the world to come when He shines upon their face like the sun? This, my children, is why I embraced the monastic life.’ &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;]]]]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1251,&quot;^Z&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]\\n \\nMaster Sophronios the sophist (before he embraced the monastic life) and I met Abba Palladios in Alexandria.

On the other hand, that they so cheerfully endured the physical torments with which the adversary the devil afflicted them. If therefore we endure affliction and persevere, with the help of God, we shall be found to be friends of God indeed. And God will be with us, fighting shoulder to shoulder with us in the battle, greatly alleviating that which we must endure. My children, since we know what kind of times these are and what kind of labour is required of us, let us strive for the self-knowledge which is attained by means of the solitary life. For at this stage it is required of us that we sincerely repent, so that we may indeed be temples of God. For it will not be honour such as the world gives that we will receive in the world to come’.  \\n \\nAgain he said: ‘Let us remember Him who has nowhere to lay his head’, Mt 8:20 and again: ‘Since Saint Paul says Trbu/ation worketh patience, Rm 5:3 let us make our minds able to receive the kingdom of heaven’. And again: ‘Children, Jet us not Jove the world, neither those things which are in the world’ \\\\ Jn 2:15. Again the elder said: “Let us keep a guard over our thoughts, for this is the medicine of salvation’.  \\n \\nWe went to the same Abba Palladios with this request; ‘Of your charity, tell us, father, where you came from, and how it came about that you embraced the monastic life’. He was from Thessa- lonica, he said, and then he told us this: ‘In my home country, about three stades beyond the city wall, there was a recluse, a native of Mesopotamia whose name was David. He was a man of outstanding virtue, merciful and continent. He spent about twenty years in his place of confinement. Now at this time, because of the barbarians, the walls of the city were patrolled at night by soldiers. One night those who were on guard-duty at that stretch of the city- walls nearest to where the elder’s place of confinement was located, saw fire pouring from the windows of the recluse’s cell. The soldiers thought the barbarians must have set the elder’s cell on fire; but  \\n \\nwhen they went out in the morning, to their amazement, they found the elder unharmed and his cell unburned. Again the following night they saw fire, the same way as before, in the elder’s cell—and this went on for a long time. The occurrence became known to all the city and throughout the countryside. Many people would come and keep vigil at the wall all night long in order to see the fire, which continued to appear until the elder died. As this phenomenon did not merely appear once or twice but was often seen, I said to myself: ‘If God so glorifies his servants in this world, how much more so in the world to come when He shines upon their face like the sun? This, my children, is why I embraced the monastic life.’

Whilst they were in the community and a source of edification for all, one of the brothers was attacked by a yearning for fornication, Unable to withstand this attack, he said to his brother: ‘Release me, brother, for I am driven towards fornication and I want to go back to the world’. The other brother began to beg and entreat him, saying: ‘Oh, brother, do not destroy all you have endured’, He replied: ‘Either come with me so that I can do the deed, or release me to go my own way’. The brother did not want to release him—so he went into the city with him. The afflicted brother went into the house of fornication whilst the other brother stood outside. Taking up dust from the ground he threw it on his own head, reproaching himself. When the brother who had gone into the brothel came out again, having done the deed, the other brother said to him: ‘My brother, what have you gained by this sin, and what have you not lost by it? Let us go back to our place’. The other replied: ‘I cannot go back into the wildemess again. You go: I am staying in the world’. When the first brother had done all he could and still failed to persuade the other to follow him into the wilderness, he too remained in the world with his brother. They both worked as labourers to support themselves. It was about this time that Abba Abraham (who had already founded the so-called ‘Monastery of the Abrahamites’ at Constantinople, he who later became Archbishop of Ephesos, a good and gentle shepherd), it was about this same that he built his own monastery, the one known as ‘The Monastery of the Byzan- tines’ at Olivet, west of Jerusalem. The two brothers came there and worked as labourers, for which they received wages. The one who had fallen prey to fornication would take both their wages and go off to the city each week where he would squander their earnings in riotous living. The other brother would fast all day long, performing his work in profound silence, not speaking to anybody. When the workmen noticed that he neither ate nor spoke each day but was always deep in thought, they told the saintly Abraham about him and his way of life. Then the great Abraham summoned the workman to his cell and asked him: “Where are you from, brother, and what kind of work so you do?’ The brother confessed all to him, ‘It is because of my brother that I put up with all this, in the hope that God will look upon my affliction and save my brother’. When the godly Abraham heard this, he said to the brother: ‘The Lord has granted you the soul of your brother too’. Abba Abraham dismissed the brother, who left his cell and, behold! there was his brother, crying: ‘My brother, take me into the wilderness so I can be saved’. He immediately took him and went to a cave near to the holy Jordan where he locked him up (in which they shut themselves). After a little while, the sinful brother, having made great spiritual progress in the things that are God’s, departed this life.

When he eventually heard that the brother was in prison, he did not know wéy he was in prison. ‘He came to me’, said the higoumen, ‘for he visited us frequently, and he said to me:  \\n \\n“Of your charity, give me a few eggs and some white bread.” I said to him: “Obviously, you have guests today”, and he said he had. He was in fact taking those provisions to the prison to offer some comfort to the brother. When he entered the prison, the brother fell at his feet and said: ‘It is on your account that I am here, abba. It is I who stole your equipment. But look: your book is in such-and- such a place and your vestment is in such-and-such a place.” The elder said to him: ‘Be assured, child, that is not why I came; neither was I in the least aware that it was because of me that you are here. But hearing that you were here, I was grieved and came to offer you some comfort. See, here is white bread and some eggs. And I will do everything I can until I get you out of prison.’ He went and interceded with some important people, for he was known to them for his virtue. They sent and released the brother from prison.\\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^1:&quot;,132,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^K&quot;,546,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,2144],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^16&quot;,546,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^12&quot;,546,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^11&quot;,546,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1263,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390a-a9eb-4a7a-aad6-0b760cb1903d&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1264,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;At the monastery of our holy father Sabas we met Athanasios.

Some time later I tonsured him, clothed him in the monastic habit and shut him up in a cave in the mountain within the city, he giving thanks to God and fighting a good fight for his own soul.\\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^1:&quot;,136,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^K&quot;,285,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,5373],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^16&quot;,285,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^12&quot;,285,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^11&quot;,285,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1267,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390b-48ec-4b5f-bc2f-7290030177ad&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1268,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;The fathers of the same monastery told us that in former times there was an elder living there named Ianthos, He spent his whole life going off to Coutila.

She said to him: ‘Do you rather come here’, for she did not know that he had been struck blind. The servant began to entreat her with oaths to approach him and she swore that she would not. He said to her: ‘Then send the child to me’, but she would not do that either, saying: ‘If you want to, you come here.’ At that, seeing that he was incapable of doing anything to help himself the servant tumed the knife around and struck himself a mortal blow. When his mistress saw what he had done, she screamed out and the neighbours came in immediately. The police arrived too and found the servant still alive. They learnt everything from him and they glorified the God who showed wonders, saving both the mother and her child.\\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^1:&quot;,146,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^K&quot;,342,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,2094],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^16&quot;,342,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^12&quot;,342,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^11&quot;,342,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1281,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390b-ffaf-4858-a35d-4eb7d30c0cfe&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1283,&quot;^1F&quot;,&quot;This_is_a_Hermitcraft_style_server_of_people_who_wish_to_cooperate_together-2e-_If_you_aren-27-t_willing_to_trust_and_be_trusted_of_others_this_server_isn-27-t_for_you-2e-&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1283,&quot;^R&quot;,[],536871139]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1283,&quot;^1G&quot;,[&quot;^1E&quot;,[]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1283,&quot;^Z&quot;,&quot;*This is a Hermitcraft style server of people who wish to cooperate together.

And this too you should know, father: that his goodness has so sheltered me that in all these seventeen years no man ever laid eyes on me until you did today.

Yet for my part, I could see all of them.’ When the anchorite learned this, he glorified God. \\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^1:&quot;,148,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^K&quot;,344,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,2321],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^16&quot;,344,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^12&quot;,344,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^11&quot;,344,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1312,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390b-0699-47a4-b5ca-1f57d6430962&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1313,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;We visited Abba Athanasios at the lavra of our saintly father, Sabas, and he told us a story which he had heard from Abba Athenogenes, Bishop of Petra, the son of Amma Damiana.

the fathers whose name was Andrew (whom we also met) say:&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;When we were in Ajexandria, Abba Andrew at the eighteenth mile post told us, saying:&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;As a young man I was very undisciplined. A war broke out and confusion reigned so, together with nine others, I fled to Palestine. One of the nine was a fellow with initiative and another was a Hebrew. When we came into the wilderness, the Hebrew became mortally sick, so we were in great distress, for we did not know what to do for him. But we did not abandon him. Each of us carried him as far as he was able. We wanted to get him to a city or to a market-town so that he should not die in the wildemess. But when the young man was completely worn out and was brought to the point of death by hunger and a burning fever, by utter exhaus- tion and a raging thirst from the heat (in fact he was about to expire), he could no longer bear to be carried. With many tears, we decided to abandon him in the wilderness and go our way. We&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;could see death from thirst lying in store for us. We were in tears when we set him down on the sand. When he saw that we were goilig to leave him, he began to adjure us, saying: ‘By the God who is going to judge both the quick and the dead, leave me to die not as a Jew, but as a Christian. Have mercy on me and baptise me so that I too may depart this life as a Christian and go to the Lord.’ We said to him: ‘Truly, brother, it is impossible for us to do anything of the sort. We are laymen and baptising is bishops’ work and ptiests’. Besides, there is no water here.’ But he continued to adjure us in the same terms and with tears, saying: ‘Oh, Christians, please do not deprive me of this benefit’. While we were most unsure what to do next, the fellow with initiative among us, inspired by God, said to us: ‘Stand him up and take off his clothes’. We got him to his feet with great difficulty and stripped him. The one with initiative filled both his hands with sand and poured it three times over the sick man’s head saying: ‘Theodore is baptised in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’, and we all answered amen to each of the names of the holy, consubstantial and worshipful Trinity. The Lord is my witness, brethren, that Christ, the Son of the living God, thus cured and re- invigorated him so that not a trace of illness remained in him. In health and vigour he ran before us during the rest of our journey through the wilderness. When we observed so great and so sudden a transformation, we all praised and glorified the ineffable majesty and loving kindness of Christ our God. When we arrived at Ascalon, we took this matter to the blessed and saintly Dionysios, who was bishop there, and told him what had happened to the brother on the journey. When the truly holy Dionysios heard of these things, he was stupefied by so extraordinary a miracle, He assembled all the clergy and put to them the question of whether he should reckon the effusion of sand as baptism or not. Some said that, in view of the extraordinary miracle, he should allow it as a valid baptism; others said he should not. Gregory the Theologian&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;enumerates all the kinds of baptism. He speaks of the Mosaic baptism, baptism in water, that is, but before that of baptism ina cloud and in the sea. ‘The baptism of John was no longer Judaic baptism, for it was not only a baptism in water, but also unto repentance. Jesus also baptised, but in the Spirit, and this is perfection. I know also a fourth baptism: that of martyrdom and of blood. And I know a fifth: the baptism of tears.’ ‘Which of these baptisms did he undergo’, asked some, ‘so that&apos;we might pronounce on its validity? For indeed the Lord said to Nicodemos: Except a man be born again of water and of the spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven Jn 3;5.’ Others objected to this: ‘How so? Since it is not written concerning the apostles that they were baptised, shall they not enter the kingdom of heaven?’ To this, others replied: ‘But indeed they were baptised, as Clement, the author of Stromatés, testifies in the fifth book of Hypotyposes.  In commenting on the saying of the Apostle Pau!, he opines: J thank God that I baptised none of you 1 Co 1:14 that Jesus is said to have baptised none but Peter; Peter to have baptised Andrew; Andrew, James and John, and they the others’. When they had said all this and much more beside, it seemed good to the blessed Bishop Dionysios to send the brother to the holy Jordan and for him to be baptised there. The fellow with initiative he ordained deacon. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;]]]]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1319,&quot;^Z&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]\\n \\nAbba Palladios told us he had heard one of the fathers whose name was Andrew (whom we also met) say:  \\n \\nWhen we were in Ajexandria, Abba Andrew at the eighteenth mile post told us, saying:  \\n \\nAs a young man I was very undisciplined. A war broke out and confusion reigned so, together with nine others, I fled to Palestine. One of the nine was a fellow with initiative and another was a Hebrew. When we came into the wilderness, the Hebrew became mortally sick, so we were in great distress, for we did not know what to do for him. But we did not abandon him. Each of us carried him as far as he was able. We wanted to get him to a city or to a market-town so that he should not die in the wildemess. But when the young man was completely worn out and was brought to the point of death by hunger and a burning fever, by utter exhaus- tion and a raging thirst from the heat (in fact he was about to expire), he could no longer bear to be carried. With many tears, we decided to abandon him in the wilderness and go our way. We  \\n \\ncould see death from thirst lying in store for us. We were in tears when we set him down on the sand. When he saw that we were goilig to leave him, he began to adjure us, saying: ‘By the God who is going to judge both the quick and the dead, leave me to die not as a Jew, but as a Christian. Have mercy on me and baptise me so that I too may depart this life as a Christian and go to the Lord.’ We said to him: ‘Truly, brother, it is impossible for us to do anything of the sort. We are laymen and baptising is bishops’ work and ptiests’. Besides, there is no water here.’ But he continued to adjure us in the same terms and with tears, saying: ‘Oh, Christians, please do not deprive me of this benefit’. While we were most unsure what to do next, the fellow with initiative among us, inspired by God, said to us: ‘Stand him up and take off his clothes’. We got him to his feet with great difficulty and stripped him. The one with initiative filled both his hands with sand and poured it three times over the sick man’s head saying: ‘Theodore is baptised in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’, and we all answered amen to each of the names of the holy, consubstantial and worshipful Trinity. The Lord is my witness, brethren, that Christ, the Son of the living God, thus cured and re- invigorated him so that not a trace of illness remained in him. In health and vigour he ran before us during the rest of our journey through the wilderness. When we observed so great and so sudden a transformation, we all praised and glorified the ineffable majesty and loving kindness of Christ our God. When we arrived at Ascalon, we took this matter to the blessed and saintly Dionysios, who was bishop there, and told him what had happened to the brother on the journey. When the truly holy Dionysios heard of these things, he was stupefied by so extraordinary a miracle, He assembled all the clergy and put to them the question of whether he should reckon the effusion of sand as baptism or not. Some said that, in view of the extraordinary miracle, he should allow it as a valid baptism; others said he should not. Gregory the Theologian  \\n \\nenumerates all the kinds of baptism. He speaks of the Mosaic baptism, baptism in water, that is, but before that of baptism ina cloud and in the sea. ‘The baptism of John was no longer Judaic baptism, for it was not only a baptism in water, but also unto repentance. Jesus also baptised, but in the Spirit, and this is perfection. I know also a fourth baptism: that of martyrdom and of blood. And I know a fifth: the baptism of tears.’ ‘Which of these baptisms did he undergo’, asked some, ‘so that&apos;we might pronounce on its validity? For indeed the Lord said to Nicodemos: Except a man be born again of water and of the spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven Jn 3;5.’ Others objected to this: ‘How so? Since it is not written concerning the apostles that they were baptised, shall they not enter the kingdom of heaven?’ To this, others replied: ‘But indeed they were baptised, as Clement, the author of Stromatés, testifies in the fifth book of Hypotyposes.  In commenting on the saying of the Apostle Pau!, he opines: J thank God that I baptised none of you 1 Co 1:14 that Jesus is said to have baptised none but Peter; Peter to have baptised Andrew; Andrew, James and John, and they the others’.

When the Maziques came and overran all that region, they came to the Great Oasis and slew many monks, while many others were taken prisoner. Among those taken prisoner at the Lavra of the Great Oasis? were Abba John, formerly lector at the Great Church in Constantinople, Abba Eustathios the Roman, and Abba Theodore, al] three of whom were sick. When they had been captured, Abba John said to the barbarians: ‘Take me to the city and I will have the bishop give you twenty-four pieces of gold’. So one of the barbarians led him off and brought him near to the city. Abba John went in to the bishop. Abba Leo was in the city at that time and so were some others of the fathers; that is why they were not captured. Abba John went in and began to implore the bishop to give the barbarian the twenty-four pieces of gold, but the bishop could only find eight. He was willing to give these to the barbarian, but he would not take them. ‘Either give me twenty-four pieces of gold or the monk’, he said. The men of the fortress had no choice but to hand over Abba John (who wept and groaned) to the barbar- ian; they took him away to their tents. Three days later, Abba Leo took the eight pieces of gold and went out into the wilderness to where the barbarians were camped. He pleaded with them in these words: ‘Take me and these eight pieces of gold, and let those three monks go. For, as they are sick and cannot work for you, you will only have to kill them. But as for me, I am in good health and I can work for you’. Then the barbarians took both him and the eight pieces of gold of which he spoke, letting the other three monks go free. Abba Leo went off somewhere with them and when he was exhausted [and could go no further], they beheaded him. And Abba Leo fulfilled that which is spoken in the scriptures: Greater Jove hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends Jn 15:13.

One day when my disciple, John, was sitting down, a serpent struck him and he died immediately with blood flowing from all his members. In my great distress, I went to the anchorites.

They came with me: they looked at him, stretched out there on the ground, then they said to me: ‘Do not be sorrowful, Abba Zosimos; God is helping’. They called the brother, saying: ‘Brother John, arise; the elder has need of you’. The brother got up from the ground at once. They looked for the snake, caught it, and cut it into two before our eyes. Then they said to me: ‘Abba Zosimos, go to Sinai; it is the will of God to entrust you with the church of Babylon’.

One of them was from Melitene, a man named Theodore; the other was from Galatia, Paul by name. Theodore was from the Monastery of Abba Euthy- mios. They wore shirts made from antelope skins. I stayed there for approximately two years; we were about two stades from each other. One day when my disciple, John, was sitting down, a serpent struck him and he died immediately with blood flowing from all his members. In my great distress, I went to the anchorites. When they saw me, distraught and distressed, before I could open my mouth, they said to me: ‘What is the matter, Abba Zosimos? Is the brother dead’? I replied that he was. They came with me: they looked at him, stretched out there on the ground, then they said to me: ‘Do not be sorrowful, Abba Zosimos; God is helping’. They called the brother, saying: ‘Brother John, arise; the elder has need of you’. The brother got up from the ground at once. They looked for the snake, caught it, and cut it into two before our eyes. Then they said to me: ‘Abba Zosimos, go to Sinai; it is the will of God to entrust you with the church of Babylon’. We immediately left those parts; and a few  \\n \\ndays after we had come to Sinai, the Abbot abbas of Sinai sent me and two others to Alexandria.

He said to me: “Forgive me, but I am not convinced”. I retired to my cell and began to search my heart to see whether any such deed had been done by me and I found nothing.

I said to myself: “The kindly deacon loves me and, prompted by his love for me, he has confided to me that which was in his heart concerning me to put me on my guard.

In those days of Eulogios, the saintly Pope of Alexandria, the future bishop of the same town of Cyrene came too. And when we were all together, he told us this: That in the time of Theophilos, the blessed Pope of Alexandria, Synesios the philosopher became Bishop of Cyrene. When he came to Cyrene, he found there a philosopher named Evagrios who had been his fellow student and had remained his good friend, even though he was strongly attached to the cult of idols. Bishop Synesios wanted to convert him. He not only wanted to, but also made great efforts and put himself to much trouble and care for the sake of the friendship in which he held him from the beginning. The other would neither be persuaded, nor would he in any way accept the bishop’s teaching. Yet, for the sake of his great friendship for him, the bishop was unfagging in his efforts, continuing day by day to instruct, entreat and exhort his friend to believe in Christ and to come to full knowledge of him. And it had this effect: that one day the philosopher said to him: ‘You know, Bishop, of all the things which you Christians say, there is this, sir, which displeases me. It is that there will be an end to this world and that, after the end, everybody who existed throughout this age shall arise in this human body and shall live for ever in that incorruptible and immortal flesh; that they shall receive their rewards, a body who has compassion on the poor lends to God; that anyone who distributes money to the poor and destitute lays up treasures in heaven and shall receive them back from Christ an hundredfold at the regener- ation, together with eternal life. All this seems to me to be deception&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;and a laughing matter; a yarn which is no more than an old wives’ tale.’ Bishop Synesios assured him that all the beliefs of the Christians were true and that there was nothing false or alien to the truth about them. He attempted to demonstrate with many examples that this was so.&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;A long time afterwards, the bishop succeeded in making him a Christian. He baptised the philosopher, his children and everybody in his household. A little while after his baptism, he gave the bishop three gold denarii for the benefit of the poor. ‘Take these three kenténaria, give then to the poor and let me have a certificate that Christ shall give them back to me in the world to come’. The bishop took the gold and promptly made out the desired certificate. The philosopher lived for some years after his baptism, and then he fell terminally ill. At the point of death, he said to his children: ‘When you prepare me for burial, put this paper in my hands and bury me with it’, When he died, they did as he had commanded and buried him together with the hand-written paper. The third day after his burial, while Bishop Synesios was lying down at night, the philos- opher appeared to him and said: ‘Come to the tomb where I lie and take your hand-written paper, for I have received what was owing to me. I am satisfied and I have no further claim on you. To make you quite sure, I have counter-signed the paper in my own hand.’ The bishop was not aware that his hand-written certificate had been buried with the philosopher.&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;The next morning he sent for the dead man’s sons and said to them: ‘What did you deposit in the tomb together with the philosopher? They thought he was speaking to them about money and they replied: ‘Nothing, my lord, except the grave clothes’. ‘What then’, he asked; ‘Did you not bury a paper with him?’ Then they remembered, for they did not realise he was talking about a paper. They said: ‘Yes, my lord; when he was dying, he gave us a paper and said: “When you prepare me for burial, lay me out that I am holding this paper in my hand, and nobody else is to know about&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;it.”’ Then the bishop told them of the dream he had seen that night. He took the sons, the clergy and some prominent citizens and went off to the philosopher’s tomb. They opened it, and they found the philosopher lying there, holding the bishop’s hand-written certificate in his own hands. They took it from his hands, opened it and found this, newly written on it, in the philosopher&apos;s hand: ‘From me, Evagrios the Philosopher, to you sir, the most holy Bishop Synesios, greetings. I have received what you wrote down in this promissory note. I am satisfied and I have no further claim on you in respect to the gold which I gave you; or rather, by your agency, to Christ our God and Saviour.’ Great was the amazement of those who saw it. For many hours they cried out: ‘Lord have mercy’, glorifying God who works wonders and grants such assurance to his servants. Master Leontios assured us that the manuscript with the philoso- pher’s signature has survived to this day and that it is lying in the treasury of the church of Cyrene. It is delivered into the safe- keeping of each man who is appointed custodian there, together with the sacred vessels. He guards it diligently and will pass it on, safe and sound, to his successors.&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;]]]]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1385,&quot;^Z&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]\\n \\nWhile we were in Alexandria, Leontios of Apamea, a devout man who loved Christ, came from Pentapolis (where he had made his home for some years at Cyrene). In those days of Eulogios, the saintly Pope of Alexandria, the future bishop of the same town of Cyrene came too. And when we were all together, he told us this: That in the time of Theophilos, the blessed Pope of Alexandria, Synesios the philosopher became Bishop of Cyrene. When he came to Cyrene, he found there a philosopher named Evagrios who had been his fellow student and had remained his good friend, even though he was strongly attached to the cult of idols. Bishop Synesios wanted to convert him. He not only wanted to, but also made great efforts and put himself to much trouble and care for the sake of the friendship in which he held him from the beginning. The other would neither be persuaded, nor would he in any way accept the bishop’s teaching. Yet, for the sake of his great friendship for him, the bishop was unfagging in his efforts, continuing day by day to instruct, entreat and exhort his friend to believe in Christ and to come to full knowledge of him. And it had this effect: that one day the philosopher said to him: ‘You know, Bishop, of all the things which you Christians say, there is this, sir, which displeases me. It is that there will be an end to this world and that, after the end, everybody who existed throughout this age shall arise in this human body and shall live for ever in that incorruptible and immortal flesh; that they shall receive their rewards, a body who has compassion on the poor lends to God; that anyone who distributes money to the poor and destitute lays up treasures in heaven and shall receive them back from Christ an hundredfold at the regener- ation, together with eternal life. All this seems to me to be deception  \\n \\nand a laughing matter; a yarn which is no more than an old wives’ tale.’ Bishop Synesios assured him that all the beliefs of the Christians were true and that there was nothing false or alien to the truth about them. He attempted to demonstrate with many examples that this was so.  \\n \\nA long time afterwards, the bishop succeeded in making him a Christian. He baptised the philosopher, his children and everybody in his household. A little while after his baptism, he gave the bishop three gold denarii for the benefit of the poor. ‘Take these three kenténaria, give then to the poor and let me have a certificate that Christ shall give them back to me in the world to come’. The bishop took the gold and promptly made out the desired certificate. The philosopher lived for some years after his baptism, and then he fell terminally ill. At the point of death, he said to his children: ‘When you prepare me for burial, put this paper in my hands and bury me with it’, When he died, they did as he had commanded and buried him together with the hand-written paper. The third day after his burial, while Bishop Synesios was lying down at night, the philos- opher appeared to him and said: ‘Come to the tomb where I lie and take your hand-written paper, for I have received what was owing to me. I am satisfied and I have no further claim on you. To make you quite sure, I have counter-signed the paper in my own hand.’ The bishop was not aware that his hand-written certificate had been buried with the philosopher.  \\n \\nThe next morning he sent for the dead man’s sons and said to them: ‘What did you deposit in the tomb together with the philosopher? They thought he was speaking to them about money and they replied: ‘Nothing, my lord, except the grave clothes’. ‘What then’, he asked; ‘Did you not bury a paper with him?’ Then they remembered, for they did not realise he was talking about a paper. They said: ‘Yes, my lord; when he was dying, he gave us a paper and said: “When you prepare me for burial, lay me out that I am holding this paper in my hand, and nobody else is to know about  \\n \\nit.”’ Then the bishop told them of the dream he had seen that night. He took the sons, the clergy and some prominent citizens and went off to the philosopher’s tomb. They opened it, and they found the philosopher lying there, holding the bishop’s hand-written certificate in his own hands. They took it from his hands, opened it and found this, newly written on it, in the philosopher&apos;s hand: ‘From me, Evagrios the Philosopher, to you sir, the most holy Bishop Synesios, greetings.

He told us this story:&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;About eight miles from the city of Samos there is an estate on which there is a church. It had a priest who was a very remarkable man, His parents had forced him to marry against his will. Not only did this man not let himself be led into the temptation of delight  (even though he was young and legally married to the woman), he even persuaded his wife to live with him in purity and continence. They both learnt the psalter and they used to sing the psalms together in church, both preserving their virginity into old age. Now it happened that a false accusation was made before the bishop against this priest. As the bishop was unaware of the true state of affairs, he sent and brought the priest from the estate and put him in the prison where it was customary to guard and detain clergy who had gone astray. Whilst he was in the prison, as the holy day of the Lord was dawning but whilst it was still night, there appeared to him an extremely handsome young man who-said to him: ‘Priest, arise: be off to your church and celebrate the eucharist’. The priest said to him: ‘I cannot, for I am a prisoner’. The apparition said to him: ‘T will open the prison. Come, follow me.’ He opened the door of the prison and led the way out. When he was out, he accom- panied the priest to within a mile of the estate. After the break of day, the jailor went in search of the prisoner and, when he could not find him, he went to the bishop, saying: ‘He has run away from me and I had the key!” Thinking that he had indeed run away, the bishop sent one of the episcopal servants, saying: &apos;Go and see if that priest is on his estate—but do not take any further action against him’, The servant went and found the priest in the church, celebrat- ing the eucharist. He returned and said to the bishop: ‘He is there, and I saw him celebrating the eucharist’. The bishop became even more angry with the priest and swore to bring him back in dishonourable custody next day.&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;The night preceding Monday, the vision he had seen earlier appeared again to the priest, saying to him: ‘Come along, we must return to that place in the city into which the bishop cast you’. He took the priest and led him back again, replacing him in the prison without the knowledge of the man who was charged with responsi- bility for it. At daybreak on Monday the bishop learned from this man that (without his knowing how it had come about) he had found the priest back in gaol. The bishop sent for the priest and demanded of him how he had got out of the prison and then come in again without the knowledge of the gaoler. This was the priest&apos;s reply: ‘A very handsome young servant, beautifully dressed, who said he was of the episcopal retinue—he opened up for me and led me to within a mile of the estate on Saturday night. He came to me again last night and brought me back’. The bishop brought forward all the episcopal servants but the priest did not recognise one of them. Then the bishop realised that il was an angel of God who had done this deed, so that the virtue of the priest should not be entirely concealed—but that all might learn of it and glorify the God who glorifies his servants. He dismissed the priest in peace whilst complaining bitterly against those who had falsely accused him.&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;]]]]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^Z&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]\\n \\nWhen we were on the island of Samos, we went to the community named Charizenos where we met the higoumen, Abba Isidore, a man of distinguished virtue with a great love for all humanity, adorned with simplicity and infinite humility; later he became bishop of the same city on Samos.

It had a priest who was a very remarkable man, His parents had forced him to marry against his will. Not only did this man not let himself be led into the temptation of delight  (even though he was young and legally married to the woman), he even persuaded his wife to live with him in purity and continence. They both learnt the psalter and they used to sing the psalms together in church, both preserving their virginity into old age. Now it happened that a false accusation was made before the bishop against this priest. As the bishop was unaware of the true state of affairs, he sent and brought the priest from the estate and put him in the prison where it was customary to guard and detain clergy who had gone astray. Whilst he was in the prison, as the holy day of the Lord was dawning but whilst it was still night, there appeared to him an extremely handsome young man who-said to him: ‘Priest, arise: be off to your church and celebrate the eucharist’. The priest said to him: ‘I cannot, for I am a prisoner’. The apparition said to him: ‘T will open the prison. Come, follow me.’ He opened the door of the prison and led the way out. When he was out, he accom- panied the priest to within a mile of the estate. After the break of day, the jailor went in search of the prisoner and, when he could not find him, he went to the bishop, saying: ‘He has run away from me and I had the key!” Thinking that he had indeed run away, the bishop sent one of the episcopal servants, saying: &apos;Go and see if that priest is on his estate—but do not take any further action against him’, The servant went and found the priest in the church, celebrat- ing the eucharist. He returned and said to the bishop: ‘He is there, and I saw him celebrating the eucharist’. The bishop became even more angry with the priest and swore to bring him back in dishonourable custody next day.  \\n \\nThe night preceding Monday, the vision he had seen earlier appeared again to the priest, saying to him: ‘Come along, we must return to that place in the city into which the bishop cast you’. He took the priest and led him back again, replacing him in the prison without the knowledge of the man who was charged with responsi- bility for it. At daybreak on Monday the bishop learned from this man that (without his knowing how it had come about) he had found the priest back in gaol. The bishop sent for the priest and demanded of him how he had got out of the prison and then come in again without the knowledge of the gaoler. This was the priest&apos;s reply: ‘A very handsome young servant, beautifully dressed, who said he was of the episcopal retinue—he opened up for me and led me to within a mile of the estate on Saturday night. He came to me again last night and brought me back’. The bishop brought forward all the episcopal servants but the priest did not recognise one of them. Then the bishop realised that il was an angel of God who had done this deed, so that the virtue of the priest should not be entirely concealed—but that all might learn of it and glorify the God who glorifies his servants. He dismissed the priest in peace whilst complaining bitterly against those who had falsely accused him.\\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^1:&quot;,192,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^K&quot;,434,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,3642],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^16&quot;,434,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^12&quot;,434,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^11&quot;,434,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1428,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390b-429d-4baf-ab09-793cdbe62f30&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1429,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;One of the fathers told us that there was formerly an archbishop of Theoupolis =Antioch whose goodness was such that once when there was a feast-day he invited several of the clergy who had celebrated the feast with him to dinner.

, I then detailed in your ears all that displeased me in myself, since for late and long I declined the grace of conversion, and after that I had been inspired with an heavenly affection I thought it better to be still shrouded in the secular habit.  For though I had now disclosed to me what I should seek of the love of things eternal, yet long-established custom had so cast its chains upon me, that I could not change my outward habit: and while my purpose (&quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;animus&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;) still compelled me to engage in the service of this world as it were in semblance only, many influences began to spring up against me from caring for this same world, so that the tie which kept me to it was now no longer in semblance only, but what is more serious, in my own mind.  At length being anxious to avoid all these inconveniences, I sought the haven of the monastery, and having left all that is of the world, as at that time I vainly believed, I came out naked from the shipwreck of human life. For as the vessel that is negligently moored, is very often (when the storm waxes violent) tossed by the water out of its shelter on the safest shore, so under the cloak of the Ecclesiastical office, I found myself d plunged on a sudden in a sea of secular matters, and because I had not held fast the tranquillity of the monastery when in possession, I learnt by losing it, how closely it should have been held.  For whereas the virtue of obedience was set against my own inclination to make me take the charge of ministering at the holy Altar, I was led to undertake that upon the grounds of the Church requiring it (&quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;sub Ecclesiae colore&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;), which, if it might be done with impunity, I should get quit of by a second time withdrawing myself; and subsequently notwithstanding my unwillingness and reluctance, at the very time when the ministry of the Altar was a heavy weight, the further burden of the Pastoral charge was fastened on me, which I now find so much the more difficulty in bearing, as I feel myself to be unequal to it, and as I cannot take breath in any comfortable assurance in myself.  For because, now that the end of the world is at hand, the times are disturbed by reason of the multiplied evils thereof, and we ourselves, who are supposed to be devoted to the inner mysteries, are thus become involved in outward cares; just as it happened then also when I was brought to the ministry of the Altar, this was brought about for me without my knowledge, viz. that I should receive the mighty charge of the Holy Order, to the end that I might be quartered under less restraint (&quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;licentious excubarem&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;) in an earthly palace, whither indeed I was followed by many of my brethren from the monastery, who were attached to me by a kindred affection (&quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;germana&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;).  Which happened, I perceive, by Divine dispensation, in order that by their example, as by an anchored cable, I might ever be kept fast to the tranquil shore of prayer, whenever I should be tossed by the ceaseless waves of secular affairs.  For to their society I fled as to the bosom of the safest port from the rolling swell, and from the waves of earthly occupation; and though that office which withdrew me from the monastery had with the point of its employments stabbed me to death as to my former tranquillity of life, yet in their society, by means of the appeals of diligent reading, I was animated with the yearnings of daily renewed compunction.  It was then that it seemed good to those same brethren, you too adding your influence, as you yourself remember, to oblige me by the importunity of their requests to set forth the book of blessed Job; and as far as the Truth should inspire me with powers, to lay open to them those mysteries of such depth; and they made this too an additional burden which their petition laid upon me, that I would not only unravel the words of the history in allegorical senses, but that I would go on to give to the allegorical senses the turn of a moral exercise, with the addition of somewhat yet harder, that I would crown (or ‘fortify,’ &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;cingerem&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;) the several meanings with testimonies, and that the testimonies, which I brought forward, should they chance to appear involved, should be disentangled by the aid of additional explanation.&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;At first however, when in this obscure work, which hitherto had been thoroughly treated by none before us, I learnt the extent and character of the task to which I was forced, being overcome and wearied with the mere burthen of hearing of it, I confess that I sank under it.  Yet immediately, when, in a strait between my alarms and my devout aspirations, I lifted up the eyes of my mind to the Bestower of all gifts &quot;],[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;James 1#^17&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[James 1#^17]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;, waiving my scruples, I fixed my thoughts on this, that what an affection flowing from the hearts of my brethren enjoined upon me, could not certainly be impossible, I despaired, indeed, of being a match for these things, but, stronger for my very despair of myself, I forthwith raised my hopes to Him, by Whom the tongue of the dumb is opened, Who &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;maketh the lips of babes to speak eloquently&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;, Wisd. 10, 21, Who has marked the undistinguished and brute brayings of an ass with the intelligible measures of human speech.  What wonder, then, that a simple man should receive understanding from Him, Who whenever He willeth, utters His truth by the mouths of the very beasts of burthen?  Armed then with the strength which this thought supplied, I roused mine own drought to explore so deep a well; and though the life of those, to whom I was compelled to give my interpretation, was far above me, yet I thought it no harm if the leaden pipe should supply streams of water for the service of men.   Whereupon, without further delay, I delivered the former parts of the book, in presence, to the same brethren assembled before me; and because I found my time to be then somewhat more free, in treating of the latter portion I used dictation; and when longer intervals of time were at my disposal, many things being added, a small number omitted, and some few left as they were, all that had been taken down in my presence as I spoke, I arranged in books with amendments.  For when I was giving the last part by dictation, I in like manner carefully considered the style in which I had spoken the first part, so that my business was both with regard to those parts, which I had given orally, by going through them with a careful correction, to bring them up to somewhat like dictation, and with regard to what I had dictated, that it should not greatly differ from the style of colloquial delivery; so that the one being drawn out, and the other contracted, that which unlike modes produced might be formed into a not inconsistent whole.  Though it must be added that the third portion of this work I have so left for the most part as I gave it by word of mouth, because the brethren, drawing me away to other things, would not have this to be corrected with any great degree of exactness.  Pursuing my object of obeying their instructions, which I must confess were sufficiently numerous, now by the work of exposition, now by the flights of contemplation, and now by moral instruction, I have completed this work extending through thirty-five books [&quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;volumina&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;], and six tomes [&quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;codicibus&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;], and hence I shall be often found therein to put rather in the background the order of exposition, and to employ myself at greater length upon the wide field of contemplation and of moral instruction.  But yet whosoever is speaking concerning God, must be careful to search out thoroughly whatsoever furnishes moral instruction to his hearers; and should account that to be the right method of ordering his discourse, if, when opportunity for edification requires it, he turn aside for a useful purpose from what he had begun to speak of; for he that treats of sacred writ should follow the way of a river, for if a river, as it flows along its channel, meets with open valleys on its side, into these it immediately turns the course of its current, and when they are copiously supplied, presently it pours itself back into its bed.  Thus unquestionably, thus should it be with everyone that treats of the Divine Word, that if, in discussing: any subject, he chance to find at hand any occasion of seasonable edification, he should, as it were, force the streams of discourse towards the adjacent valley, and, when he has poured forth enough upon its level of instruction, fall back into the channel of discourse which he had proposed to himself.&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;But be it known that there are some parts, which we go through in a historical exposition, some we trace out in allegory upon an investigation of the typical meaning, some we open in the lessons of moral teaching alone, allegorically conveyed, while there are some few which, with more particular care, we search out in all these ways together, exploring them in a threefold method.  For first, we lay the historical foundations; next, by pursuing the typical sense, we erect a fabric of the mind to be a strong hold of faith; and moreover as the last step, by the grace of moral instruction, we, as it were, clothe the edifice with an overcast of colouring.  Or at least how are the declarations of truth to be accounted of, but as food for the refreshment of the mind?  These being handled with the alternate application of various methods, we serve up the viands of discourse in such sort as to prevent all disgust in the reader, thus invited as our guest, who, upon consideration of the various things presented to him, is to take that which he determines to be the choicest.  Yet it sometimes happens that we neglect to interpret the plain words of the historical account, that we may not be too long in coming to the hidden senses, and sometimes they cannot be understood according to the letter, because when taken superficially, they convey no sort of instruction to the reader, but only engender error; for here, for instance, it is said, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Under Whom they are bent who bear the world&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;. &quot;],[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Job 9#^13&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Job 9#^13]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;.  Now in the case of one so great, who can be ignorant that he never so fol1ows the vain fictions of the poets, as to fancy the weight of the world to be supported by the labour of the giants.  Again, under the pressure of calamities he exclaims, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than life&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;. [Jov 7, 15]  Now who that is in his right senses could believe that a man of so high praise, who in a word, we know, received from the Judge of that which is within the reward of the virtue of patience, settled amidst his afflictions to finish his life by strangling?  And sometimes even the very literal words forbid its being supposed that perchance they ought to be understood according to the letter.  Thus he says, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; [Job 3, 3]  And a little while afterwards he subjoins, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Let darkness seize it, and let it be involved in bitterness.&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; [ver. 5] And in cursing the same night he adds, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Lo! let that night be solitary&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;.  Assuredly this day of his birth, which rolled itself out in the mere current of time, could never stand fast.  In what way then did he wish it might be involved in darkness?  For having gone by, it no longer was, neither yet, if it had existence in the nature of things, could it ever feel &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;bitterness;&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; it is evident therefore that the words cannot possibly be spoken of a day without feeling, when the wish expressed is that it be struck with a feeling of bitterness; and if the night of his conception had gone by, blended with the other nights, after what fashion would he have it become solitary, which as it could not be arrested from the flight of time, so neither could it be separated from union with the other nights.  Again he says, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;How long wilt Thou not depart from me, nor let me alone, till I swallow down my spittle&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;. [Job 7, 19] Yet he had said a little above, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;The things which my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; [Job 6, 7]  Now who does not know that spittle is more easily swallowed than food? it is wholly inconceivable then in what connection he, who tells of his taking food, declares that he cannot swallow his spittle.  Again he says, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O Thou preserver of men?&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; [Job 7, 20]  Or more unequivocally, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Wouldest Thou destroy me by the iniquities of my youth.&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; [Job 13, 26]  And yet in another answer he subjoins, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; [Job 27, 6]  How then does his heart not condemn him so long as he lives, who by a public avowal testifies that he has been a sinner, for faultiness of practice and acquittal of conscience can never meet together. Yet doubtless whereas the literal words when set against each other cannot be made to agree, they point out some other meaning in themselves which we are to seek for, as if with a kind of utterance they said, Whereas ye see our superficial form to be destructive to us, look for what may be found within us that is in place and consistent with itself.&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;But sometimes, he who neglects to interpret the historical form of words according to the letter, keeps that light of truth concealed which is presented to him, and in laboriously seeking to find in them a further interior meaning, he loses that which he might easily obtain on the outside. Thus the Saint saith, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;if I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;  . . . if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; if his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; [Job 31, 16-20] where it is to be observed, that if these words be violently strained to an allegorical signification, we make void all his acts of mercy. For as the word of God, by the mysteries which it contains, exercises the understanding of the wise, so usually by what presents itself on the outside, it nurses the simple-minded.  It presenteth in open day that wherewith the little ones may be fed; it keepeth in secret that whereby men of a loftier range may be held in suspense of admiration.  It is, as it were, a kind of river, if I may so liken it, which is both shallow [&quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;planus&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;] and deep, wherein both the lamb may find a footing, and the elephant float at large.  Therefore as the fitness of each passage requires, the line of interpretation is studiously varied accordingly, in that the true sense of the word of God is found out with so much the greater fidelity, in proportion as it shifts its course through the different kinds of examples as each case may require.&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;This exposition being such as I have described, I have transmitted to your Blessedness for your inspection, not as being due for its worth&apos;s sake, but because I remember that I promised it on your making the request.  In which whatsoever your Holiness may discover that is languid or unpolished, let it be most readily excused in proportion as the circumstance is known that it was said in a state of sickness; for when the body is worn down with sickness, the mind being also affected, our exertions to express ourselves likewise become faint.  For many a year&apos;s circuit has gone by since I have been afflicted with frequent pains in the bowels, and the powers of my stomach being broken down, makes me at all times and seasons weakly; and under the influence of fevers, slow, but in constant succession, I draw my breath with difficulty; and when in the midst of these sufferings I ponder with earnest heed, that according to the testimony of Scripture, &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; [Heb. 12, 6] the more I am weighed down by the severity of present afflictions, from my anticipations for eternity, I gather strength to breathe with so much the better assurance.  And perchance it was this that Divine Providence designed, that I a stricken one, should set forth Job stricken, and that by these scourges I should the more perfectly enter into the feelings of one that was scourged.  Yet it will be evident to all that consider the thing aright, that bodily ailment hinders the pursuits wherein I labour, and that with no slight power of opposition in this respect, that, when the powers of the flesh are not strong enough to discharge the office of speech, the mind cannot adequately convey its meaning.  For what is the office of the body saving to be the organ of the mind; and though the musician be ever so skilled in playing [&quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;cantandi&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;], he cannot put his art in practice unless outward aids accord with himself for that purpose, for we know that the melody [&quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;canticum&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;] which the hand of the proficient bids, is not rightly given back by instruments that are out of order; nor does the wind express his art, if the pipe, gaping with crevices, gives a grating sound.  How much more affected in quality then is a thing like this exposition of mine, wherein the grace of delivery is so dissipated by the broken condition of the instrument, that no contrivance of skill can avail to recover it!  But I beg that in going through the statements of this work, you would not seek the foliage of eloquence therein: for by the sacred oracles the vanity of a barren wordiness is purposely debarred those that treat thereof, in that it is forbidden to plant a grove in the temple of God. And doubtless we are all of us aware, that as often as the overrank crop shews stalks that abound in leaves, the grains of the ears are least filled and swelling.  And hence that art of speaking itself, which is conveyed by rules of worldly training, I have despised to observe; for as the tenor of this Epistle also will tell, I do not escape the collisions of metacism, nor do I avoid the confusion of barbarisms, and I slight the observing of situations and arrangements, and the cases of prepositions; for I account it very far from meet to submit the words of the divine Oracle to the rules of Donatus.  For neither are these observed by any of the translators thereof, in the authoritative [&quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;auctoritate&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;] text of Holy Writ.  Now as my exposition takes its origin from thence, it is plainly meet that this production, like a kind of offspring, should wear the likeness of its mother.  Now it is the new Translation that I comment on; but when a case to be proved requires it, I take now the new and now the old for testimony, that as the Apostolic See, over which I preside by ordinance of God, uses both, the labours of my undertaking may have the support of both.&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;],[&quot;Footnote_Reference&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^23&quot;,4,&quot;^20&quot;,&quot;a&quot;]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;: Leander, who is honoured as a Saint and Doctor in Spain, was a native of Carthagena; his father Severianus was brother in law to Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths.  He early devoted himself to a monastic life, and after a long continuance in it he was made Bishop of Seville, where he maintained the Faith against the Arianism which then prevailed, and received Herminigild, who reigned there under his father Liuvigild, into the church.  He went on an embassy to the Emperor Tiberius as presently stated, after which he returned to Spain, but was banished for a time by Liuvigild, who, however, on his deathbed appointed him tutor to his son Recared, whom he converted from Arianism, and with his assistance established the Catholic Faith amongst the Wisigoths and Suevi.  He took part (and perhaps presided, see Baronius An. 589. s. ix. and xliv. Boll. Act. Sanct. Ap. xiii. p. 277.) in the third Council of Toledo, in which the Goths were united to the Catholic Church, A.D. 589.  He died in 595.  He wrote a rule for Virgins to his sister Florentina, which is extant in Holstein&apos;s Codex Regularum, a Homily of his, on the conversion of the Goths, accompanies the acts of the Synod of Toledo, and the Mozarabic Missal is said by some to be founded on one arranged by him; his other works are lost.  See Cave, Hist. Lit. an. 585. also the Isidoriana of Arevalus in his edition of St. Isidore, Rome 1797.  There are three epistles of St. Gregory to Leander, Lib. i.

Jan. xiv. p. 971. and his sister Florentina, Ap. xiv. and Jun xx. who devoted herself to a life of Virginity, are locally honoured as Saints.  He was succeeded in the See of Seville (then called &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Hispalis,&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;) by his younger brother St. Isidore.&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;],[&quot;Footnote_Reference&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^23&quot;,5,&quot;^20&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;: &quot;],[&quot;Emphasis&quot;,[[&quot;Italic&quot;],[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Responsa,&quot;]]]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; these were all matters concerning the Roman See, that were brought under the notice of the Emperor, and the person intrusted with them was entitled Apocrisiarius.  He was the Pope&apos;s Ambassador at the Imperial Court with varying powers.  He was one of the Cardinal Deacons, for which reason S.

Gibbon speaks of St. Gregory&apos;s services at the Imperial Court thus; &apos;As soon as he had received the character of Deacon Gregory was sent to reside at the Imperial Court, and he boldly assumed in the name of St. Peter a tine of independent dignity which would have been criminal and dangerous in the most illustrious layman of the empire.\\&quot;  See his history x.xlv.

He found means however to return into Spain, and maintained himself by the help of the Greeks against his father, and it is at this time that his conduct in attempting a surprise is severely blamed by St. Gregory of Tours, Hist. Franc. vi. 43.  He was at last overpowered, and taken prisoner.  St. Gregory of Rome, Dial. iii. 31, says, that he was then urged by his father to communicate with an Arian Bishop, and after resisting alike promises and threats, was put to death.  he also mentions a supernatural light that surrounded his body.  These circumstances are not noticed by St. Isidore or St. Greg. of Tours.  Liuvigild however very soon after acknowledged privately the true faith, and recalled Leander, and placed his son and successor Recared under his direction.  Herminigild is honoured as a Maryr by the Latin Church, Apr. 13.  See Isidorianna caps. xviii. and lxxxix.

For as the vessel that is negligently moored, is very often (when the storm waxes violent) tossed by the water out of its shelter on the safest shore, so under the cloak of the Ecclesiastical office, I found myself d plunged on a sudden in a sea of secular matters, and because I had not held fast the tranquillity of the monastery when in possession, I learnt by losing it, how closely it should have been held.  For whereas the virtue of obedience was set against my own inclination to make me take the charge of ministering at the holy Altar, I was led to undertake that upon the grounds of the Church requiring it (*sub Ecclesiae colore*), which, if it might be done with impunity, I should get quit of by a second time withdrawing myself; and subsequently notwithstanding my unwillingness and reluctance, at the very time when the ministry of the Altar was a heavy weight, the further burden of the Pastoral charge was fastened on me, which I now find so much the more difficulty in bearing, as I feel myself to be unequal to it, and as I cannot take breath in any comfortable assurance in myself.  For because, now that the end of the world is at hand, the times are disturbed by reason of the multiplied evils thereof, and we ourselves, who are supposed to be devoted to the inner mysteries, are thus become involved in outward cares; just as it happened then also when I was brought to the ministry of the Altar, this was brought about for me without my knowledge, viz. that I should receive the mighty charge of the Holy Order, to the end that I might be quartered under less restraint (*licentious excubarem*) in an earthly palace, whither indeed I was followed by many of my brethren from the monastery, who were attached to me by a kindred affection (*germana*).  Which happened, I perceive, by Divine dispensation, in order that by their example, as by an anchored cable, I might ever be kept fast to the tranquil shore of prayer, whenever I should be tossed by the ceaseless waves of secular affairs.  For to their society I fled as to the bosom of the safest port from the rolling swell, and from the waves of earthly occupation; and though that office which withdrew me from the monastery had with the point of its employments stabbed me to death as to my former tranquillity of life, yet in their society, by means of the appeals of diligent reading, I was animated with the yearnings of daily renewed compunction.  It was then that it seemed good to those same brethren, you too adding your influence, as you yourself remember, to oblige me by the importunity of their requests to set forth the book of blessed Job; and as far as the Truth should inspire me with powers, to lay open to them those mysteries of such depth; and they made this too an additional burden which their petition laid upon me, that I would not only unravel the words of the history in allegorical senses, but that I would go on to give to the allegorical senses the turn of a moral exercise, with the addition of somewhat yet harder, that I would crown (or ‘fortify,’ *cingerem*) the several meanings with testimonies, and that the testimonies, which I brought forward, should they chance to appear involved, should be disentangled by the aid of additional explanation.\\n\\n At first however, when in this obscure work, which hitherto had been thoroughly treated by none before us, I learnt the extent and character of the task to which I was forced, being overcome and wearied with the mere burthen of hearing of it, I confess that I sank under it.  Yet immediately, when, in a strait between my alarms and my devout aspirations, I lifted up the eyes of my mind to the Bestower of all gifts [[James 1#^17]], waiving my scruples, I fixed my thoughts on this, that what an affection flowing from the hearts of my brethren enjoined upon me, could not certainly be impossible, I despaired, indeed, of being a match for these things, but, stronger for my very despair of myself, I forthwith raised my hopes to Him, by Whom the tongue of the dumb is opened, Who *maketh the lips of babes to speak eloquently*, Wisd. 10, 21, Who has marked the undistinguished and brute brayings of an ass with the intelligible measures of human speech.  What wonder, then, that a simple man should receive understanding from Him, Who whenever He willeth, utters His truth by the mouths of the very beasts of burthen?  Armed then with the strength which this thought supplied, I roused mine own drought to explore so deep a well; and though the life of those, to whom I was compelled to give my interpretation, was far above me, yet I thought it no harm if the leaden pipe should supply streams of water for the service of men.   Whereupon, without further delay, I delivered the former parts of the book, in presence, to the same brethren assembled before me; and because I found my time to be then somewhat more free, in treating of the latter portion I used dictation; and when longer intervals of time were at my disposal, many things being added, a small number omitted, and some few left as they were, all that had been taken down in my presence as I spoke, I arranged in books with amendments.  For when I was giving the last part by dictation, I in like manner carefully considered the style in which I had spoken the first part, so that my business was both with regard to those parts, which I had given orally, by going through them with a careful correction, to bring them up to somewhat like dictation, and with regard to what I had dictated, that it should not greatly differ from the style of colloquial delivery; so that the one being drawn out, and the other contracted, that which unlike modes produced might be formed into a not inconsistent whole.  Though it must be added that the third portion of this work I have so left for the most part as I gave it by word of mouth, because the brethren, drawing me away to other things, would not have this to be corrected with any great degree of exactness.  Pursuing my object of obeying their instructions, which I must confess were sufficiently numerous, now by the work of exposition, now by the flights of contemplation, and now by moral instruction, I have completed this work extending through thirty-five books [*volumina*], and six tomes [*codicibus*], and hence I shall be often found therein to put rather in the background the order of exposition, and to employ myself at greater length upon the wide field of contemplation and of moral instruction.  But yet whosoever is speaking concerning God, must be careful to search out thoroughly whatsoever furnishes moral instruction to his hearers; and should account that to be the right method of ordering his discourse, if, when opportunity for edification requires it, he turn aside for a useful purpose from what he had begun to speak of; for he that treats of sacred writ should follow the way of a river, for if a river, as it flows along its channel, meets with open valleys on its side, into these it immediately turns the course of its current, and when they are copiously supplied, presently it pours itself back into its bed.  Thus unquestionably, thus should it be with everyone that treats of the Divine Word, that if, in discussing: any subject, he chance to find at hand any occasion of seasonable edification, he should, as it were, force the streams of discourse towards the adjacent valley, and, when he has poured forth enough upon its level of instruction, fall back into the channel of discourse which he had proposed to himself.\\n\\n But be it known that there are some parts, which we go through in a historical exposition, some we trace out in allegory upon an investigation of the typical meaning, some we open in the lessons of moral teaching alone, allegorically conveyed, while there are some few which, with more particular care, we search out in all these ways together, exploring them in a threefold method.  For first, we lay the historical foundations; next, by pursuing the typical sense, we erect a fabric of the mind to be a strong hold of faith; and moreover as the last step, by the grace of moral instruction, we, as it were, clothe the edifice with an overcast of colouring.  Or at least how are the declarations of truth to be accounted of, but as food for the refreshment of the mind?  These being handled with the alternate application of various methods, we serve up the viands of discourse in such sort as to prevent all disgust in the reader, thus invited as our guest, who, upon consideration of the various things presented to him, is to take that which he determines to be the choicest.  Yet it sometimes happens that we neglect to interpret the plain words of the historical account, that we may not be too long in coming to the hidden senses, and sometimes they cannot be understood according to the letter, because when taken superficially, they convey no sort of instruction to the reader, but only engender error; for here, for instance, it is said, *Under Whom they are bent who bear the world*. [[Job 9#^13]].  Now in the case of one so great, who can be ignorant that he never so fol1ows the vain fictions of the poets, as to fancy the weight of the world to be supported by the labour of the giants.  Again, under the pressure of calamities he exclaims, _So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than life_. [Jov 7, 15]  Now who that is in his right senses could believe that a man of so high praise, who in a word, we know, received from the Judge of that which is within the reward of the virtue of patience, settled amidst his afflictions to finish his life by strangling?  And sometimes even the very literal words forbid its being supposed that perchance they ought to be understood according to the letter.  Thus he says, _Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived._ [Job 3, 3]  And a little while afterwards he subjoins, _Let darkness seize it, and let it be involved in bitterness._ [ver. 5] And in cursing the same night he adds, _Lo! let that night be solitary_.  Assuredly this day of his birth, which rolled itself out in the mere current of time, could never stand fast.  In what way then did he wish it might be involved in darkness?  For having gone by, it no longer was, neither yet, if it had existence in the nature of things, could it ever feel _bitterness;_ it is evident therefore that the words cannot possibly be spoken of a day without feeling, when the wish expressed is that it be struck with a feeling of bitterness; and if the night of his conception had gone by, blended with the other nights, after what fashion would he have it become solitary, which as it could not be arrested from the flight of time, so neither could it be separated from union with the other nights.  Again he says, _How long wilt Thou not depart from me, nor let me alone, till I swallow down my spittle_. [Job 7, 19] Yet he had said a little above, _The things which my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat._ [Job 6, 7]  Now who does not know that spittle is more easily swallowed than food? it is wholly inconceivable then in what connection he, who tells of his taking food, declares that he cannot swallow his spittle.  Again he says, _I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O Thou preserver of men?_ [Job 7, 20]  Or more unequivocally, _Wouldest Thou destroy me by the iniquities of my youth._ [Job 13, 26]  And yet in another answer he subjoins, _My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live._ [Job 27, 6]  How then does his heart not condemn him so long as he lives, who by a public avowal testifies that he has been a sinner, for faultiness of practice and acquittal of conscience can never meet together. Yet doubtless whereas the literal words when set against each other cannot be made to agree, they point out some other meaning in themselves which we are to seek for, as if with a kind of utterance they said, Whereas ye see our superficial form to be destructive to us, look for what may be found within us that is in place and consistent with itself.\\n\\nBut sometimes, he who neglects to interpret the historical form of words according to the letter, keeps that light of truth concealed which is presented to him, and in laboriously seeking to find in them a further interior meaning, he loses that which he might easily obtain on the outside. Thus the Saint saith, _if I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;  . . . if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; if his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;_ [Job 31, 16-20] where it is to be observed, that if these words be violently strained to an allegorical signification, we make void all his acts of mercy. For as the word of God, by the mysteries which it contains, exercises the understanding of the wise, so usually by what presents itself on the outside, it nurses the simple-minded.  It presenteth in open day that wherewith the little ones may be fed; it keepeth in secret that whereby men of a loftier range may be held in suspense of admiration.  It is, as it were, a kind of river, if I may so liken it, which is both shallow [_planus_] and deep, wherein both the lamb may find a footing, and the elephant float at large.  Therefore as the fitness of each passage requires, the line of interpretation is studiously varied accordingly, in that the true sense of the word of God is found out with so much the greater fidelity, in proportion as it shifts its course through the different kinds of examples as each case may require.\\n\\n This exposition being such as I have described, I have transmitted to your Blessedness for your inspection, not as being due for its worth&apos;s sake, but because I remember that I promised it on your making the request.  In which whatsoever your Holiness may discover that is languid or unpolished, let it be most readily excused in proportion as the circumstance is known that it was said in a state of sickness; for when the body is worn down with sickness, the mind being also affected, our exertions to express ourselves likewise become faint.  For many a year&apos;s circuit has gone by since I have been afflicted with frequent pains in the bowels, and the powers of my stomach being broken down, makes me at all times and seasons weakly; and under the influence of fevers, slow, but in constant succession, I draw my breath with difficulty; and when in the midst of these sufferings I ponder with earnest heed, that according to the testimony of Scripture, _He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;_ [Heb. 12, 6] the more I am weighed down by the severity of present afflictions, from my anticipations for eternity, I gather strength to breathe with so much the better assurance.  And perchance it was this that Divine Providence designed, that I a stricken one, should set forth Job stricken, and that by these scourges I should the more perfectly enter into the feelings of one that was scourged.  Yet it will be evident to all that consider the thing aright, that bodily ailment hinders the pursuits wherein I labour, and that with no slight power of opposition in this respect, that, when the powers of the flesh are not strong enough to discharge the office of speech, the mind cannot adequately convey its meaning.  For what is the office of the body saving to be the organ of the mind; and though the musician be ever so skilled in playing [_cantandi_], he cannot put his art in practice unless outward aids accord with himself for that purpose, for we know that the melody [_canticum_] which the hand of the proficient bids, is not rightly given back by instruments that are out of order; nor does the wind express his art, if the pipe, gaping with crevices, gives a grating sound.  How much more affected in quality then is a thing like this exposition of mine, wherein the grace of delivery is so dissipated by the broken condition of the instrument, that no contrivance of skill can avail to recover it!  But I beg that in going through the statements of this work, you would not seek the foliage of eloquence therein: for by the sacred oracles the vanity of a barren wordiness is purposely debarred those that treat thereof, in that it is forbidden to plant a grove in the temple of God. And doubtless we are all of us aware, that as often as the overrank crop shews stalks that abound in leaves, the grains of the ears are least filled and swelling.  And hence that art of speaking itself, which is conveyed by rules of worldly training, I have despised to observe; for as the tenor of this Epistle also will tell, I do not escape the collisions of metacism, nor do I avoid the confusion of barbarisms, and I slight the observing of situations and arrangements, and the cases of prepositions; for I account it very far from meet to submit the words of the divine Oracle to the rules of Donatus.  For neither are these observed by any of the translators thereof, in the authoritative [_auctoritate_] text of Holy Writ.  Now as my exposition takes its origin from thence, it is plainly meet that this production, like a kind of offspring, should wear the likeness of its mother.  Now it is the new Translation that I comment on; but when a case to be proved requires it, I take now the new and now the old for testimony, that as the Apostolic See, over which I preside by ordinance of God, uses both, the labours of my undertaking may have the support of both.\\n\\n [^a]: Leander, who is honoured as a Saint and Doctor in Spain, was a native of Carthagena; his father Severianus was brother in law to Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths.  He early devoted himself to a monastic life, and after a long continuance in it he was made Bishop of Seville, where he maintained the Faith against the Arianism which then prevailed, and received Herminigild, who reigned there under his father Liuvigild, into the church.  He went on an embassy to the Emperor Tiberius as presently stated, after which he returned to Spain, but was banished for a time by Liuvigild, who, however, on his deathbed appointed him tutor to his son Recared, whom he converted from Arianism, and with his assistance established the Catholic Faith amongst the Wisigoths and Suevi.  He took part (and perhaps presided, see Baronius An. 589. s. ix. and xliv. Boll. Act. Sanct. Ap. xiii. p. 277.) in the third Council of Toledo, in which the Goths were united to the Catholic Church, A.D. 589.  He died in 595.  He wrote a rule for Virgins to his sister Florentina, which is extant in Holstein&apos;s Codex Regularum, a Homily of his, on the conversion of the Goths, accompanies the acts of the Synod of Toledo, and the Mozarabic Missal is said by some to be founded on one arranged by him; his other works are lost.  See Cave, Hist. Lit. an. 585. also the Isidoriana of Arevalus in his edition of St. Isidore, Rome 1797.  There are three epistles of St. Gregory to Leander, Lib. i. Ep. 43, companying the Pallium.  His brother Fulgentius, Bp. of Carthagena and Eceja, Bolland. Jan. xiv. p. 971. and his sister Florentina, Ap. xiv. and Jun xx. who devoted herself to a life of Virginity, are locally honoured as Saints.  He was succeeded in the See of Seville (then called _Hispalis,_) by his younger brother St. Isidore.\\n\\n [^b]: _Responsa,_ these were all matters concerning the Roman See, that were brought under the notice of the Emperor, and the person intrusted with them was entitled Apocrisiarius.  He was the Pope&apos;s Ambassador at the Imperial Court with varying powers.  He was one of the Cardinal Deacons, for which reason S. Greg. on being appointed to this office was ordained Deacon, vide Du Cange in voce Apocrisiarius; also Bingham Antiq. b. iii. c. xiii. s. 6. where the office is correctly described. vide Baronius Ann. tom. x. p. 378. (an. 583. xii. xiii.) Gibbon speaks of St. Gregory&apos;s services at the Imperial Court thus; &apos;As soon as he had received the character of Deacon Gregory was sent to reside at the Imperial Court, and he boldly assumed in the name of St. Peter a tine of independent dignity which would have been criminal and dangerous in the most illustrious layman of the empire.\\&quot;  See his history x.xlv. Lond. 1813. t. viii. p. 164. also p. 143.\\n\\n[^c]: Herminigild was deposed by Liuvigild, chiefly, it seems, for embracing the Catholic Faith.  The contemporary writers however, both St. Gregory of Tours and St. Isidore, consider him to have acted wrongly toward his father.  Baronious indeed says that Leander went on an embassy to ask help for him from the Emperor, which he obtained, but the Greed officers betrayed his cause.  An ancient Roman Breviary however says he went to Constantinople to attend the Council, &apos;Pro confirmandis capitulis Sanctae Trinitatis,&apos; to confirm the articles on the Holy trinity.  This he may have done previously, the fifth General Council being A.D. 553.  Herminigild was unsuccessful, and obliged to leave his kingdom. He found means however to return into Spain, and maintained himself by the help of the Greeks against his father, and it is at this time that his conduct in attempting a surprise is severely blamed by St. Gregory of Tours, Hist. Franc. vi. 43.  He was at last overpowered, and taken prisoner.  St. Gregory of Rome, Dial. iii. 31, says, that he was then urged by his father to communicate with an Arian Bishop, and after resisting alike promises and threats, was put to death.  he also mentions a supernatural light that surrounded his body.  These circumstances are not noticed by St. Isidore or St. Greg. of Tours.  Liuvigild however very soon after acknowledged privately the true faith, and recalled Leander, and placed his son and successor Recared under his direction.  Herminigild is honoured as a Maryr by the Latin Church, Apr. 13.  See Isidorianna caps. xviii. and lxxxix. S. Isid. hist. Goth. c. 49.  The account of Mariana is more circumstantial, but seems partly imaginary.\\n\\n[^d]: He was sent to Constantinople as Apocrisiarius immediately upon his ordination, Bar. an. 583.  The Benedictive Biographer places the event earlier, in 578 or 579. life l. i. c. 5. op. t. iv. p. 211.\\n\\n[^e]:There\\n\\n---\\ntags: #needsEdit #HolyFathers &quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^1:&quot;,199,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^13&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^K&quot;,1436,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1I&quot;,[],&quot;^1J&quot;,[],&quot;^1K&quot;,52,&quot;^1L&quot;,24135],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^16&quot;,514,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^12&quot;,514,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^11&quot;,326,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^11&quot;,349,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^11&quot;,514,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^11&quot;,523,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^11&quot;,609,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^L&quot;,326,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^L&quot;,349,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^L&quot;,523,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^L&quot;,609,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^1S&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1437,&quot;^Y&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;THE BOOKS OF THE MORALS OF ST.

No matter at what hour visitors arrived for the purpose of prayer, it was the practice of those fathers, once they had offered their prayers, to set the table for them and immediately to eat some food’. \\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^1:&quot;,201,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^K&quot;,530,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,788],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^16&quot;,530,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^12&quot;,530,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^11&quot;,530,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1438,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390b-c6aa-46ef-9f70-81c53014d0c9&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1439,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;A pagan Saracen told this to the inhabitants of Clisma =Suez and to us:&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;I went to the mountain of Abba Anthony to hunt.

The Scripture readings indicate to us more loudly than any trumpet and more distinctly than any musical instrument the Feast that precedes these days. For we have learned from Isaiah the Grace to be gained from the fasts. Isaiah rejected the Jewish way of fasting and showed us what true fasting means. “Fast not for quarrels and strifes, but loose every bond of iniquity.” And the Lord says: “Be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance, but anoint thine head, and wash thy face.” Let us, therefore, exhibit the demeanor that we have been taught, not being doleful about the coming days, but maintaining a joyful attitude, as befits holy people. No one who desponds is crowned; no one who sulks sets up a trophy of victory. Do not be sullen while you are being healed. It would be absurd not to rejoice over the health of your soul, but rather to be distressed over a change of diet and to give the impression of setting more store by the pleasure of your stomach than by the care of your soul. For satiety brings delight to the stomach, whereas fasting brings profit to the soul. Be of good cheer, for the physician has given you a medicine that destroys sin. For, just as the tapeworms that breed in the intestines of children are obliterated by certain very pungent drugs, so also fasting—a remedy truly worthy of its appellation—, when introduced into the soul, kills off the sin that lurks deep within it. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;“Anoint thine head, and wash thy face.” This sentence summons you to mysteries. One who has been anointed has received unction; he who has been washed has been cleansed. Apply this injunction to your inner members. Wash your soul clean of sins. Have your head anointed with holy oil, so that you might become a partaker of Christ, and approach the fast in this spirit. Do not disfigure your face as do the hypocrites. The face is disfigured when one’s inner disposition is obscured by a sham external appearance, concealed by falsehood as if beneath a veil. An actor in a theatre is one who assumes someone else’s persona—if he is a slave, he often plays a master, and if he is a private citizen, he plays a king. Likewise, in this life, as if on some stage, the majority of people turn their existence into a theatre, entertaining one thing in their hearts, but displaying something else to men by their outward appearance. Therefore, do not disfigure your face. Whatever you may be, appear as such. Do not transform yourself into a sullen person, seeking the glory that comes from appearing to be abstemious. For there is no profit in trumpeting your good deeds, nor any gain in advertising your fasting. Things that are done for outward show do not yield any fruit in the age to come, but terminate in human praise. Run with gladness to the gift of the fast. Fasting is an ancient gift, which does not grow old or become outmoded, but is ever renewed and flourishes with vigor. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Do you think that I am resting the origin of fasting on the Law? Why, fasting is even older than the Law. If you wait a little, you will discover the truth of what I have said. Do not suppose that fasting originated with the Day of Atonement, appointed for Israel on the tenth day of the seventh month. No, go back through history and inquire into the ancient origins of fasting. It is not a recent invention; it is an heirloom handed down by our fathers. Everything distinguished by antiquity is venerable. Have respect for the antiquity of fasting. It is as old as humanity itself; it was prescribed in Paradise. It was the first commandment that Adam received: “Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ye shall not eat.” Through the words “ye shall not eat” the law of fasting and abstinence is laid down. If Eve had fasted from the tree, we would not now be in need of this fast. “They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.” We have been wounded through sin; we are healed through repentance, but repentance without fasting is fruitless. “Cursed is the ground.... Thorns and this tles shall it bring forth for thee.” You were ordered to live in sorrow, not in luxury. Make amends to God through fasting. Yet even life in Paradise is an image of fasting, not only insofar as man, sharing the life of the Angels, attained to likeness with them through being contented with little, but also insofar as those things which human ingenuity subsequently invented had not yet been devised by those living in Paradise, be it the drinking of wine, the slaughter of animals, or whatever else befuddles the human mind. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Since we did not fast, we fell from Paradise; let us, therefore, fast in order that we might return thither. Do you not see how Lazarus entered Paradise through fasting? Do not emulate the disobedience of Eve; never again accept the advice of the serpent, who suggested eating out of regard for the flesh. Do not use bodily sickness and infirmity as an excuse for not fasting. You are not offering such excuses to me, but to Him Who knows all about you. Tell me, you are unable to fast, and yet you are able eat to satiety throughout your life and oppress your body with the burden of what you eat? And yet, I know of doctors who prescribe for sick people not a variety of foods, but fasting and abstinence. How is it, then, that, while you are able to carry out doctors’ orders, you allege that you are unable to keep the fasts ordained by the Church? What is easier for the stomach? To pass the night after observing a frugal diet, or to lie in bed weighed down by an abundance of foods? Or rather, not lying down, but tossing and turning, heaving and groaning—unless you are going to say that it is easier for a helmsman to save a vessel weighed down with cargo than one that is less encumbered and lighter. The one that is laden with a multitude of goods will be submerged when any wave, no matter how low, rears up against it, whereas the one carrying a moderate quantity of freight easily rides the waves, there being nothing to prevent it from rising above the surge. Likewise, the bodies of men, when weighed down by constant surfeiting, easily become overwhelmed by illnesses, whereas, when they avail themselves of simple and easily-digested fare, they not only escape, as from the eruption of a tempest, the suffering that is to be expected from any disease, but also repel like the onslaught of a squall the sickness that is already present within them. In your view, I suppose, it is more laborious to rest than to run and to be still than to struggle—if, indeed, you assert that it is more appropriate for those who are ill to indulge in delicacies than to observe a frugal diet. For the force that governs living creatures naturally engenders moderation and frugality and adapts itself to that which is eaten; but when the body ingests sumptuous and varied foods, this force, being entirely unable to tolerate them, gives rise to a variety of diseases. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;But let our discourse proceed to history in reviewing the antiquity of fasting, and how all of the Saints, receiving it as an ancestral legacy, preserved it in the way that fathers hand things on to their children; thus, this possession has come down to us by a process of successive transmission. There was no wine in Paradise, nor any slaughter of animals, nor any consumption of meat. After the flood, there was wine; after the flood came the ordinance: “Eat all things as the green herb.” When hope of human perfection was abandoned, then enjoyment was permitted. Noah, who knew nothing about the use of wine, is proof that men had no experience thereof. For wine had not yet found its way into human life, nor had men become accustomed to it. Therefore, when he had neither seen anyone else drinking wine nor tried it himself, he unguardedly succumbed to the harm that comes therefrom: “For Noah...planted a vineyard; and he drank of its fruit, and became drunk”; not because he was a drunkard, but because he did not know how much wine he could imbibe. Thus, the discovery of wine-drinking is more recent than Paradise, so ancient is the dignity of fasting. Moreover, we know that Moses ascended the mountain while fasting. For he would not have dared to touch the peak of the mountain while it was smoking, nor would he have made bold to enter the darkness, had he not been armed with fasting. It was through fasting that he received the commandment inscribed on the tablets by the finger of God. Above, fasting ushered in the Law; below, gluttony led to the madness of idolatry. “And the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.” The forty days in which the servant of God waited on God in fasting and prayer were rendered futile by a single drinking bout. For the tablets inscribed by the finger of God that Moses obtained were shattered by drunkenness, since the Prophet did not judge the drunken people worthy to receive the Law from God. In one moment of time that people, who had been taught about God through stupendous miracles, plunged headlong, through gluttony, into the idol-madness of the Egyptians. Now juxtapose both of these facts: how fasting brings one close to God, and how indulgence drives away salvation. Once you descend to indulgence, you are on the road to perdition. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;What ruined Esau and made him a slave of his brother? Was it not a single act of eating, which caused him to sell his birthright? Was it not prayer combined with fasting that bestowed Samuel on his mother? What was it that rendered the mighty champion Samson invincible? Was it not fasting, with which he was conceived in his mother’s womb? Fasting gave birth to him; fasting suckled him; fasting made him grow to manhood, and an Angel enjoined this fast on his mother: “She shall not eat of anything that cometh from the vine, neither shall she drink wine or strong drink.” Fasting gives birth to prophets and strengthens the powerful; fasting makes lawgivers wise. Fasting is a good safeguard for the soul, a steadfast companion for the body, a weapon for the valiant, and a gymnasium for athletes. Fasting repels temptations, anoints unto piety; it is the comrade of watchfulness and the artificer of chastity. In war it fights bravely, in peace it teaches stillness. It sanctifies the Nazirite and perfects the Priest. For it is not possible to dare to perform sacred actions without fasting, not only in the mystical and true worship of the present era, but also in the symbolic worship offered according to the Law. Fasting made Elias a beholder of that great vision; for, having cleansed his soul by fasting for forty days, he was thus vouchsafed, in the cave in Horeb, to behold the Lord as far as it is possible for a man to do so. While fasting he restored to the widow her son, having been fortified against death itself through fasting. A voice that went forth from the mouth of one fasting shut the heavens for the transgressing people for three years and six months. For, in order to soften the untamed heart of his stiff-necked people, he chose to condemn himself to hardship together with them. Hence, he said: “As the Lord liveth, there shall not be water upon the earth, except by the word of my mouth.” He brought a fast upon the people through famine, so as to correct the evil caused by their dissolute life of luxury. What kind of life did Elissaios have? How did he enjoy hospitality from the Shunamite woman? How did he himself welcome the prophets? Did he not fulfill the duties of hospitality with wild greens and a little flour? At that time, after the gourd had been placed in the pottage, those who had tasted it would have been in peril, had not the poison been neutralized by the prayer of the faster. There is a physical substance called amianthus, which is noncombustible, and which, when placed in a flame, appears to glow like coal, but emerges purer when removed from the fire, as if it has been brightened and cleansed with water. Such were the bodies of those three Youths in Babylon, which, on account of their fasting, possessed the properties of amianthus. For in the fiery furnace, as if they were golden by nature, they thus proved to be invulnerable to the fire. In fact, they proved to be stronger than gold. For the fire did not smelt them, but preserved them intact. And yet, nothing could have withstood those flames, which were being fed with naphtha, pitch, and brushwood, to such an extent that they streamed forth forty-nine cubits into the air and, feeding on what surrounded them, consumed many of the Chaldæans. Entering that conflagration, therefore, armed with fasting, the Youths trampled it underfoot, breathing refined and dew-laden air in such a fierce fire. The fire did not dare to touch even their hair, because they had been nourished by fasting. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Daniel, a man greatly beloved, who ate no bread and drank no water for three weeks, when he descended into the den, taught even lions to fast. The lions were not able to sink their teeth into him, as if he were made of stone, bronze, or some other harder material. Thus, fasting, as when iron is dipped in water, had toughened that man’s body and rendered it impregnable to lions; for they did not even open their mouths against the Saint. Fasting extinguished the power of fire and stopped the mouths of lions. Fasting sends up prayer to Heaven, becoming, as it were, a wing for it on its upward journey. Fasting is the enhancement of households, the mother of health, the guide of the young, the adornment of elders, the good companion of wayfarers, the steadfast comrade of married couples. A husband does not suspect a plot against his marriage when he sees his wife observing the fast. A wife does not pine with envy when she sees her husband embracing the fast. Who has ever diminished his resources during a fast? Count up today what is in your house, and after a fast count it again. You will not have run short of any household goods because of the fast. No animal laments death, nowhere is there any blood, no sentence is pronounced against animals by the inexorable stomach. The knives of cooks are checked; the table is content with foods that grow naturally. The Sabbath was given to the Jews, Scripture says, that your beast of burden and your servant might enjoy a rest. Let the fast be a rest from constant toils for the menials who serve you throughout the year. Give your cook a break, grant your footman a holiday; stay the hand of your cupbearer. Let your pastry cook have a vacation from time to time. Let your household at last have some respite from the never-ending commotion, smoke, the odor of fat, and people running hither and thither and ministering, as it were, to that implacable mistress, the stomach. In any case, even tax-collectors sometimes give small breaks to those who owe them money. Let the stomach give the mouth some rest, and let it make a truce with us for five days—for otherwise it is always making demands and never desists, receiving today and forgetting tomorrow. When it is full, it philosophizes about abstinence; when it is deflated, it forgets such ideas. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Fasting knows nothing of loans; the table of a faster does not reek of usury. A father’s debts do not suffocate the orphaned son of a faster like serpents that coil themselves around their victims. In other ways, too, fasting is the occasion of gladness. For, just as thirst makes a drink refreshing and prior hunger makes a meal pleasant, so also fasting heightens our enjoyment of food. For, by interposing itself and interrupting your constant self-indulgence, it will make the consumption of food appear desirable to you, like an absent friend. Hence, if you wish to make a meal appetizing, accept the transformation that comes about in you from fasting. Because of your intense addiction to lavish fare, you have dulled your enjoyment of food without realizing it, ruining pleasure through hedonism. For nothing is so desirable that it does not become contemptible through constant gratification. It is the things that rarely come our way that we enjoy with the greatest avidity. Thus, He Who created us provided that we should take abiding delight in His gifts through an alternation in our lifestyle. Do you not see that the sun is more resplendent after the night, that being awake is more pleasant after sleep, that health is more desirable after the experience of the opposite condition, and that the meal table is more gratifying after a fast? It is the same for the rich and those who dine sumptuously as it is for those whose diet is frugal and improvised. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Fear the example of the rich man, who was consigned to the fire by his lifelong luxury. It was not for injustice that he was condemned, but for his sumptuous lifestyle, and for this reason he was tormented in the fiery furnace of Hell. Now, in order to extinguish that fire, we need water. Fasting is beneficial not only for the life to come, but even more is it profitable for the flesh itself. For even those in the peak of condition experience reverses and changes, when nature fails and proves unable to maintain an abundance of good health. Beware of spurning water now, lest you subsequently find yourself longing for a drop of it, as did the rich man. No one has ever gotten drunk on water. No one has ever contracted headaches from drinking too much water. No one who drinks only water has ever needed someone else’s feet. No one has lost the use of his feet or hands through their being nourished with water. Bad digestion, which inevitably dogs those who indulge in dainties, causes serious bodily disorders. The complexion of a faster is venerable, not breaking out in unseemly red blotches, but adorned with the pallor of temperance. His gaze is calm, his gait is sedate, his countenance is thoughtful—not demeaned by unrestrained laughter—, his speech is moderate, and his heart is pure. Call to mind the Saints from all ages, “of whom the world was not worthy, [who] wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented.” Emulate their way of life, if you seek their portion. What was it that gave Lazarus rest in the bosom of Abraham? Was it not fasting? The life of John the Baptist was one continuous fast. He did not have a bed, a table, arable land, a plough ox, wheat, a quern, or anything else that pertains to nourishment. For this reason, “Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.” Among other things, fasting, which Paul reckoned among the afflictions in which he gloried, raised him up to the third Heaven. To cap all that we have said, our Lord, having fortified through fasting the flesh which He assumed for our sake, submitted to the attacks of the Devil therewith, both instructing us to anoint and train ourselves with fasting for the struggles that we must undergo amid temptations and affording the adversary a handle, so to speak, through hunger. For on account of the height of His Divinity He would have been inaccessible to the Devil, had He not submitted to human weakness through hunger. However, before He ascended back to Heaven, He tasted food, giving assurance of the true nature of His risen body. Will you not give up fattening and gorging yourself? Will you allow your mind to waste away through lack of nourishment, because you take no thought for saving and life-giving teachings? Or do you not know that, just as in the case of a battle those who fight for one side cause the defeat of the other, so he who sides with the flesh prevails over the spirit, while he who aligns himself with the spirit brings his flesh into subjection? “&quot;],[&quot;Latex_Fragment&quot;,[&quot;Displayed&quot;,&quot;For&quot;]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; these &quot;],[&quot;Latex_Fragment&quot;,[&quot;Displayed&quot;,&quot;flesh and spirit&quot;]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; are contrary the one to the other.” Hence, if you wish to make your mind strong, tame your flesh through fasting. For this is what the Apostle says, that to the extent that our outward man perishes, our inward man is renewed; he also says: “&quot;],[&quot;Latex_Fragment&quot;,[&quot;Displayed&quot;,&quot;W&quot;]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;hen I am weak, then am I strong.” Will you not disdain perishable foods? Will you not conceive a desire for the table in the Kingdom of Heaven, for which fasting here on earth is assuredly a preparation? Do you not know that by immoderate satiety you fatten for yourself the worm that torments? For who amid lavish feasting and perpetual delectation has become the partaker of any spiritual gift? Moses needed a second fast in order to receive the second set of laws. If the animals had not fasted along with the Ninevites, the Ninevites would not have escaped the threat of destruction. Whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? Were they not those of the people who demanded to eat meat? As long as they were content with manna and water from the rock, they overcame the Egyptians and journeyed through the sea; there was not a feeble one among their tribes.” But when they recalled the fleshpots and returned to Egypt in their desires, they did not see the Promised Land. Do you not fear their example? Do you not shudder at their gluttony, lest it exclude you from the good things for which we hope? But not even the wise Daniel would have seen visions, had he not rendered his soul more pellucid through fasting. For certain thick vapors are emitted from rich foods, which, like a dense cloud, prevent the illumination produced by the Holy Spirit from entering the mind. But if there is any food that is proper even to Angels, it is bread, as the Prophet says: “Man ate the bread of Angels”—not meat, nor wine, nor those items that are zealously sought after by those enslaved to their stomachs. Fasting is a weapon against the army of demons. “&quot;],[&quot;Latex_Fragment&quot;,[&quot;Displayed&quot;,&quot;For&quot;]],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; this kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.” So many are the benefits of fasting, whereas satiety is the beginning of lasciviousness. For sybaritism, inebriation, and all manner of rich foods immediately give rise to every kind of brutish wantonness. Hence, men become lecherous stallions on account of the frenzy wrought in the soul by self-indulgence. Perversions of nature arise from drunkards when they seek the feminine in the masculine and the masculine in the feminine. Fasting teaches moderation in conjugal relations, and, by chastising intemperance even in licit sexual activity, engenders abstinence by mutual agreement, so that married couples may devote themselves to prayer. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Do not, however, define the benefit that comes from fasting solely in terms of abstinence from foods. For true fasting consists in estrangement from vices. “Loose every burden of iniquity.” Forgive your neighbor the distress he causes you; forgive him his debts. “Fast not for quarrels and strifes.” You do not eat meat, but you devour your brother. You abstain from wine, but do not restrain yourself from insulting others. You wait until evening to eat, but waste your day in law courts. Woe to those who get drunk, but not from wine. Anger is inebriation of the soul, making it deranged, just as wine does. Grief is also a form of intoxication, one that submerges the intellect. Fear is another kind of drunkenness, when we have phobias regarding inappropriate objects; for Scripture says: “Rescue my soul from fear of the enemy.” And in general, every passion which causes mental derangement may justly be called drunkenness. Pray consider a man smitten with anger, how he is inebriated by this passion. He is not in control of himself, he does not know who he is, nor does he know those around him. He attacks everyone and collides with everyone just as in a night-battle; he speaks recklessly, cannot restrain himself, rails, pounds his fists, utters threats, swears, shouts, and becomes apoplectic. Avoid such inebriation as this, and do not accept the inebriation that comes from wine. Do not precede the season in which you drink only water by consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. Let not drunkenness initiate you into the fast. For neither through greed do you attain to righteousness, nor through wantonness to temperance, nor, in short, through vice to virtue. The door to fasting is a different one. Inebriation leads to wantonness, frugality to fasting. An athlete trains before a contest; a faster practices abstinence before a fast. Do not indulge in drunkenness before the five days as if taking revenge for the days of fasting or attempting to outwit the Lawgiver. For you toil in vain if you afflict your body, but do not receive consolation for your privation. The receptacle is unreliable, you are drawing water with a perforated jar. For wine flows through your body, coursing along its own path, but sin remains in you. A servant runs away from a master who beats him; but you cleave to wine, which beats your head every day? Bodily need is the best criterion for the use of wine. If you exceed your limits, on the following day you will have headaches, you will be listless and dizzy, and you will reek of putrid wine. Everything will seem to you to be spinning around and unstable. For drunkenness not only brings on sleep, the brother of death, but also a wakefulness that resembles dreams. &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Do you know Whom you are going to receive? He Who gave us this promise: “I and my Father will come unto him, and make Our abode with him.” Why do you forestall Him by inebriation and prevent the Master from entering you? Why do you encourage the enemy to occupy your ramparts? Inebriation does not receive the Lord; inebriation drives away the Holy Spirit. For smoke drives bees away, while drunkenness drives away spiritual gifts. Fasting is the adornment of a city, the stability of the marketplace, peace in the home, and security of possessions. Do you want to see its dignity? Pray compare this evening with tomorrow evening, and you will see a city transformed from tumult and commotion into profound tranquillity. Would that today might resemble tomorrow in dignity, and that tomorrow might yield nothing to today in gladness. May the Lord Who has brought us to this period of the year grant us, as contenders, to display steadfast and vigorous perseverance in these preliminary contests and to attain to the Day of the Lord, whereon crowns are bestowed, so that we might now commemorate the saving Passion of Christ, and in the age to come enjoy the reward for our deeds in life at the just Judgment of Christ Himself, for unto Him be glory unto the ages. Amen.&quot;]]]]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1470,&quot;^1G&quot;,[&quot;^1E&quot;,[]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1470,&quot;^Z&quot;,&quot;# On Fasting Homily I \\nby [[St Basil the Great]] Archbishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia\\n\\n“Sound the trumpet at the new moon,” says the Psalmist, “in the notable day of your feast.” This injunction is prophetic. The Scripture readings indicate to us more loudly than any trumpet and more distinctly than any musical instrument the Feast that precedes these days. For we have learned from Isaiah the Grace to be gained from the fasts. Isaiah rejected the Jewish way of fasting and showed us what true fasting means. “Fast not for quarrels and strifes, but loose every bond of iniquity.” And the Lord says: “Be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance, but anoint thine head, and wash thy face.” Let us, therefore, exhibit the demeanor that we have been taught, not being doleful about the coming days, but maintaining a joyful attitude, as befits holy people. No one who desponds is crowned; no one who sulks sets up a trophy of victory. Do not be sullen while you are being healed. It would be absurd not to rejoice over the health of your soul, but rather to be distressed over a change of diet and to give the impression of setting more store by the pleasure of your stomach than by the care of your soul. For satiety brings delight to the stomach, whereas fasting brings profit to the soul. Be of good cheer, for the physician has given you a medicine that destroys sin. For, just as the tapeworms that breed in the intestines of children are obliterated by certain very pungent drugs, so also fasting—a remedy truly worthy of its appellation—, when introduced into the soul, kills off the sin that lurks deep within it. \\n\\n“Anoint thine head, and wash thy face.” This sentence summons you to mysteries. One who has been anointed has received unction; he who has been washed has been cleansed. Apply this injunction to your inner members. Wash your soul clean of sins. Have your head anointed with holy oil, so that you might become a partaker of Christ, and approach the fast in this spirit. Do not disfigure your face as do the hypocrites. The face is disfigured when one’s inner disposition is obscured by a sham external appearance, concealed by falsehood as if beneath a veil. An actor in a theatre is one who assumes someone else’s persona—if he is a slave, he often plays a master, and if he is a private citizen, he plays a king. Likewise, in this life, as if on some stage, the majority of people turn their existence into a theatre, entertaining one thing in their hearts, but displaying something else to men by their outward appearance. Therefore, do not disfigure your face. Whatever you may be, appear as such. Do not transform yourself into a sullen person, seeking the glory that comes from appearing to be abstemious. For there is no profit in trumpeting your good deeds, nor any gain in advertising your fasting. Things that are done for outward show do not yield any fruit in the age to come, but terminate in human praise. Run with gladness to the gift of the fast. Fasting is an ancient gift, which does not grow old or become outmoded, but is ever renewed and flourishes with vigor. \\n\\nDo you think that I am resting the origin of fasting on the Law? Why, fasting is even older than the Law. If you wait a little, you will discover the truth of what I have said. Do not suppose that fasting originated with the Day of Atonement, appointed for Israel on the tenth day of the seventh month. No, go back through history and inquire into the ancient origins of fasting. It is not a recent invention; it is an heirloom handed down by our fathers. Everything distinguished by antiquity is venerable. Have respect for the antiquity of fasting. It is as old as humanity itself; it was prescribed in Paradise. It was the first commandment that Adam received: “Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ye shall not eat.” Through the words “ye shall not eat” the law of fasting and abstinence is laid down. If Eve had fasted from the tree, we would not now be in need of this fast. “They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.” We have been wounded through sin; we are healed through repentance, but repentance without fasting is fruitless. “Cursed is the ground.... Thorns and this tles shall it bring forth for thee.” You were ordered to live in sorrow, not in luxury. Make amends to God through fasting. Yet even life in Paradise is an image of fasting, not only insofar as man, sharing the life of the Angels, attained to likeness with them through being contented with little, but also insofar as those things which human ingenuity subsequently invented had not yet been devised by those living in Paradise, be it the drinking of wine, the slaughter of animals, or whatever else befuddles the human mind. \\n\\nSince we did not fast, we fell from Paradise; let us, therefore, fast in order that we might return thither. Do you not see how Lazarus entered Paradise through fasting? Do not emulate the disobedience of Eve; never again accept the advice of the serpent, who suggested eating out of regard for the flesh. Do not use bodily sickness and infirmity as an excuse for not fasting. You are not offering such excuses to me, but to Him Who knows all about you. Tell me, you are unable to fast, and yet you are able eat to satiety throughout your life and oppress your body with the burden of what you eat? And yet, I know of doctors who prescribe for sick people not a variety of foods, but fasting and abstinence. How is it, then, that, while you are able to carry out doctors’ orders, you allege that you are unable to keep the fasts ordained by the Church? What is easier for the stomach? To pass the night after observing a frugal diet, or to lie in bed weighed down by an abundance of foods? Or rather, not lying down, but tossing and turning, heaving and groaning—unless you are going to say that it is easier for a helmsman to save a vessel weighed down with cargo than one that is less encumbered and lighter. The one that is laden with a multitude of goods will be submerged when any wave, no matter how low, rears up against it, whereas the one carrying a moderate quantity of freight easily rides the waves, there being nothing to prevent it from rising above the surge. Likewise, the bodies of men, when weighed down by constant surfeiting, easily become overwhelmed by illnesses, whereas, when they avail themselves of simple and easily-digested fare, they not only escape, as from the eruption of a tempest, the suffering that is to be expected from any disease, but also repel like the onslaught of a squall the sickness that is already present within them. In your view, I suppose, it is more laborious to rest than to run and to be still than to struggle—if, indeed, you assert that it is more appropriate for those who are ill to indulge in delicacies than to observe a frugal diet. For the force that governs living creatures naturally engenders moderation and frugality and adapts itself to that which is eaten; but when the body ingests sumptuous and varied foods, this force, being entirely unable to tolerate them, gives rise to a variety of diseases. \\n\\nBut let our discourse proceed to history in reviewing the antiquity of fasting, and how all of the Saints, receiving it as an ancestral legacy, preserved it in the way that fathers hand things on to their children; thus, this possession has come down to us by a process of successive transmission. There was no wine in Paradise, nor any slaughter of animals, nor any consumption of meat. After the flood, there was wine; after the flood came the ordinance: “Eat all things as the green herb.” When hope of human perfection was abandoned, then enjoyment was permitted. Noah, who knew nothing about the use of wine, is proof that men had no experience thereof. For wine had not yet found its way into human life, nor had men become accustomed to it. Therefore, when he had neither seen anyone else drinking wine nor tried it himself, he unguardedly succumbed to the harm that comes therefrom: “For Noah...planted a vineyard; and he drank of its fruit, and became drunk”; not because he was a drunkard, but because he did not know how much wine he could imbibe. Thus, the discovery of wine-drinking is more recent than Paradise, so ancient is the dignity of fasting. Moreover, we know that Moses ascended the mountain while fasting. For he would not have dared to touch the peak of the mountain while it was smoking, nor would he have made bold to enter the darkness, had he not been armed with fasting. It was through fasting that he received the commandment inscribed on the tablets by the finger of God. Above, fasting ushered in the Law; below, gluttony led to the madness of idolatry. “And the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.” The forty days in which the servant of God waited on God in fasting and prayer were rendered futile by a single drinking bout. For the tablets inscribed by the finger of God that Moses obtained were shattered by drunkenness, since the Prophet did not judge the drunken people worthy to receive the Law from God. In one moment of time that people, who had been taught about God through stupendous miracles, plunged headlong, through gluttony, into the idol-madness of the Egyptians. Now juxtapose both of these facts: how fasting brings one close to God, and how indulgence drives away salvation. Once you descend to indulgence, you are on the road to perdition. \\n\\nWhat ruined Esau and made him a slave of his brother? Was it not a single act of eating, which caused him to sell his birthright? Was it not prayer combined with fasting that bestowed Samuel on his mother? What was it that rendered the mighty champion Samson invincible? Was it not fasting, with which he was conceived in his mother’s womb? Fasting gave birth to him; fasting suckled him; fasting made him grow to manhood, and an Angel enjoined this fast on his mother: “She shall not eat of anything that cometh from the vine, neither shall she drink wine or strong drink.” Fasting gives birth to prophets and strengthens the powerful; fasting makes lawgivers wise. Fasting is a good safeguard for the soul, a steadfast companion for the body, a weapon for the valiant, and a gymnasium for athletes. Fasting repels temptations, anoints unto piety; it is the comrade of watchfulness and the artificer of chastity. In war it fights bravely, in peace it teaches stillness. It sanctifies the Nazirite and perfects the Priest. For it is not possible to dare to perform sacred actions without fasting, not only in the mystical and true worship of the present era, but also in the symbolic worship offered according to the Law. Fasting made Elias a beholder of that great vision; for, having cleansed his soul by fasting for forty days, he was thus vouchsafed, in the cave in Horeb, to behold the Lord as far as it is possible for a man to do so. While fasting he restored to the widow her son, having been fortified against death itself through fasting. A voice that went forth from the mouth of one fasting shut the heavens for the transgressing people for three years and six months. For, in order to soften the untamed heart of his stiff-necked people, he chose to condemn himself to hardship together with them. Hence, he said: “As the Lord liveth, there shall not be water upon the earth, except by the word of my mouth.” He brought a fast upon the people through famine, so as to correct the evil caused by their dissolute life of luxury. What kind of life did Elissaios have? How did he enjoy hospitality from the Shunamite woman? How did he himself welcome the prophets? Did he not fulfill the duties of hospitality with wild greens and a little flour? At that time, after the gourd had been placed in the pottage, those who had tasted it would have been in peril, had not the poison been neutralized by the prayer of the faster. There is a physical substance called amianthus, which is noncombustible, and which, when placed in a flame, appears to glow like coal, but emerges purer when removed from the fire, as if it has been brightened and cleansed with water. Such were the bodies of those three Youths in Babylon, which, on account of their fasting, possessed the properties of amianthus. For in the fiery furnace, as if they were golden by nature, they thus proved to be invulnerable to the fire. In fact, they proved to be stronger than gold. For the fire did not smelt them, but preserved them intact. And yet, nothing could have withstood those flames, which were being fed with naphtha, pitch, and brushwood, to such an extent that they streamed forth forty-nine cubits into the air and, feeding on what surrounded them, consumed many of the Chaldæans. Entering that conflagration, therefore, armed with fasting, the Youths trampled it underfoot, breathing refined and dew-laden air in such a fierce fire. The fire did not dare to touch even their hair, because they had been nourished by fasting. \\n\\nDaniel, a man greatly beloved, who ate no bread and drank no water for three weeks, when he descended into the den, taught even lions to fast. The lions were not able to sink their teeth into him, as if he were made of stone, bronze, or some other harder material. Thus, fasting, as when iron is dipped in water, had toughened that man’s body and rendered it impregnable to lions; for they did not even open their mouths against the Saint. Fasting extinguished the power of fire and stopped the mouths of lions. Fasting sends up prayer to Heaven, becoming, as it were, a wing for it on its upward journey. Fasting is the enhancement of households, the mother of health, the guide of the young, the adornment of elders, the good companion of wayfarers, the steadfast comrade of married couples. A husband does not suspect a plot against his marriage when he sees his wife observing the fast. A wife does not pine with envy when she sees her husband embracing the fast. Who has ever diminished his resources during a fast? Count up today what is in your house, and after a fast count it again. You will not have run short of any household goods because of the fast. No animal laments death, nowhere is there any blood, no sentence is pronounced against animals by the inexorable stomach. The knives of cooks are checked; the table is content with foods that grow naturally. The Sabbath was given to the Jews, Scripture says, that your beast of burden and your servant might enjoy a rest. Let the fast be a rest from constant toils for the menials who serve you throughout the year. Give your cook a break, grant your footman a holiday; stay the hand of your cupbearer. Let your pastry cook have a vacation from time to time. Let your household at last have some respite from the never-ending commotion, smoke, the odor of fat, and people running hither and thither and ministering, as it were, to that implacable mistress, the stomach. In any case, even tax-collectors sometimes give small breaks to those who owe them money. Let the stomach give the mouth some rest, and let it make a truce with us for five days—for otherwise it is always making demands and never desists, receiving today and forgetting tomorrow. When it is full, it philosophizes about abstinence; when it is deflated, it forgets such ideas. \\n\\nFasting knows nothing of loans; the table of a faster does not reek of usury. A father’s debts do not suffocate the orphaned son of a faster like serpents that coil themselves around their victims. In other ways, too, fasting is the occasion of gladness. For, just as thirst makes a drink refreshing and prior hunger makes a meal pleasant, so also fasting heightens our enjoyment of food. For, by interposing itself and interrupting your constant self-indulgence, it will make the consumption of food appear desirable to you, like an absent friend. Hence, if you wish to make a meal appetizing, accept the transformation that comes about in you from fasting. Because of your intense addiction to lavish fare, you have dulled your enjoyment of food without realizing it, ruining pleasure through hedonism. For nothing is so desirable that it does not become contemptible through constant gratification. It is the things that rarely come our way that we enjoy with the greatest avidity. Thus, He Who created us provided that we should take abiding delight in His gifts through an alternation in our lifestyle. Do you not see that the sun is more resplendent after the night, that being awake is more pleasant after sleep, that health is more desirable after the experience of the opposite condition, and that the meal table is more gratifying after a fast? It is the same for the rich and those who dine sumptuously as it is for those whose diet is frugal and improvised. \\n\\nFear the example of the rich man, who was consigned to the fire by his lifelong luxury. It was not for injustice that he was condemned, but for his sumptuous lifestyle, and for this reason he was tormented in the fiery furnace of Hell. Now, in order to extinguish that fire, we need water. Fasting is beneficial not only for the life to come, but even more is it profitable for the flesh itself. For even those in the peak of condition experience reverses and changes, when nature fails and proves unable to maintain an abundance of good health. Beware of spurning water now, lest you subsequently find yourself longing for a drop of it, as did the rich man. No one has ever gotten drunk on water. No one has ever contracted headaches from drinking too much water. No one who drinks only water has ever needed someone else’s feet. No one has lost the use of his feet or hands through their being nourished with water. Bad digestion, which inevitably dogs those who indulge in dainties, causes serious bodily disorders. The complexion of a faster is venerable, not breaking out in unseemly red blotches, but adorned with the pallor of temperance. His gaze is calm, his gait is sedate, his countenance is thoughtful—not demeaned by unrestrained laughter—, his speech is moderate, and his heart is pure. Call to mind the Saints from all ages, “of whom the world was not worthy, [who] wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented.” Emulate their way of life, if you seek their portion. What was it that gave Lazarus rest in the bosom of Abraham? Was it not fasting? The life of John the Baptist was one continuous fast. He did not have a bed, a table, arable land, a plough ox, wheat, a quern, or anything else that pertains to nourishment. For this reason, “Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.” Among other things, fasting, which Paul reckoned among the afflictions in which he gloried, raised him up to the third Heaven. To cap all that we have said, our Lord, having fortified through fasting the flesh which He assumed for our sake, submitted to the attacks of the Devil therewith, both instructing us to anoint and train ourselves with fasting for the struggles that we must undergo amid temptations and affording the adversary a handle, so to speak, through hunger.

Will you allow your mind to waste away through lack of nourishment, because you take no thought for saving and life-giving teachings? Or do you not know that, just as in the case of a battle those who fight for one side cause the defeat of the other, so he who sides with the flesh prevails over the spirit, while he who aligns himself with the spirit brings his flesh into subjection? “\\\\[For\\\\] these \\\\[flesh and spirit\\\\] are contrary the one to the other.” Hence, if you wish to make your mind strong, tame your flesh through fasting. For this is what the Apostle says, that to the extent that our outward man perishes, our inward man is renewed; he also says: “\\\\[W\\\\]hen I am weak, then am I strong.” Will you not disdain perishable foods? Will you not conceive a desire for the table in the Kingdom of Heaven, for which fasting here on earth is assuredly a preparation?

He came to the monastery of the Besoi at Soubiba and made an offering. He asked the abba of the monastery of his charity to send someone to the neighbouring monastery of the Syrians so that they too could come and receive a donation; and he wanted them to pass on the invitation to the monastery of Chérembé, so that those who lived there would come too. So the abba sent a brother to the higoumen of the:monastery of the Syrians at Soubiba. When the brother arrived, he said to him: ‘Come to the monastery of the Besoi and send a message to the monastery of Chérembé that they should come’. The elder replied: ‘Ihave nobody to send.

There were two monks with him from the Syrians’ monastery at Soubiba. This is what they told us:  \\n \\nTen days ago, an elder from afar arrived. He came to the monastery of the Besoi at Soubiba and made an offering. He asked the abba of the monastery of his charity to send someone to the neighbouring monastery of the Syrians so that they too could come and receive a donation; and he wanted them to pass on the invitation to the monastery of Chérembé, so that those who lived there would come too. So the abba sent a brother to the higoumen of the:monastery of the Syrians at Soubiba. When the brother arrived, he said to him: ‘Come to the monastery of the Besoi and send a message to the monastery of Chérembé that they should come’. The elder replied: ‘Ihave nobody to send. But do you, of your exceeding great charity, go and tel] them.’ The brother said: ‘I have never been there before and I do not know the way’. Then the elder said to his little dog: ‘Go with the brother to the community of Chérembé so that he can deliver his message’.

The three elders sat discreetly apart; one of them took the holy gospel out of his travelling-bag and began to read aloud. When the harlot who was with the youths saw the elder begin to read, she came and sat down near him, forsaking the youths. The elder drove her off, saying to her: “Wretched woman, you seem very indecent. Are you not ashamed to come and sit near us?’ In reply she answered: ‘Oh father, please do not treat me with loathing. Even if I am filled with every kind of sin, the master of all, our Lord and God, did not send away the harlot who came to him.’ The elder answered her: ‘But that harlot remained a harlot no longer’. She said to him: ‘My hope is in the Son of the living God that from this day forward neither will I continue in this sin’. Forsaking the youths and everything she had, she followed the elders. They placed her in a women’s monastery called Nakkiba, near Egaion. I saw her as an old woman of great  \\n \\nexperience.

Many joined the holy catholic and apostolic Church on account of their faith in this miracle. \\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^1:&quot;,246,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^K&quot;,579,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,2505],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^16&quot;,579,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^12&quot;,579,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^11&quot;,579,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1515,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390c-c2d8-40d8-aca7-c1a887e04096&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1516,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Two philosophers came to an elder and asked him to say something beneficial to them.

The mother and child is then to not return to the Church until the 40th day for the child to be baptized. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n---\\ntags: #writing &quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^1:&quot;,252,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^13&quot;,3,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^K&quot;,1523,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1I&quot;,[],&quot;^1J&quot;,[],&quot;^1K&quot;,3318,&quot;^1L&quot;,4183],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^16&quot;,307,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^12&quot;,307,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^11&quot;,307,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^11&quot;,436,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^11&quot;,583,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^L&quot;,436,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^L&quot;,583,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^1S&quot;,3,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^Y&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;Purification&quot;]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^14&quot;,&quot;^1T&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^1B&quot;,false,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1524,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390c-b85d-43d0-8ac8-dc01e22ba03c&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1525,&quot;^R&quot;,[&quot;^1?&quot;,[[&quot;Paragraph&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Spiritual Meadow]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;One of the saints said:&quot;],[&quot;Hard_Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot; &quot;],[&quot;Break_Line&quot;],[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;When we pray to the Lord and say Lead us not into temptation, we are not saying this so that we shall not be tried; that would be impossible.

I want him to celebrate the eucharist this day. When the pope awoke, he said to himself concerning the vision he had seen: ‘I have received such a complaint against him, and Ae is to celebrate the eucharist?’ A second time the voice came to him in his sleep, saying: ‘I told you: that bishop; who is in prison, 4e shall celebrate the eucharist’, Likewise a third time the figure appeared to him as he was grappling with the problem and said the same thing to him. When the pope awoke, he sent to the prison and had the bishop brought out. Then he questioned him: ‘What is your way of life ergasia? But the bishop would answer nothing other than: ‘I am a sinner’. As he could not persuade the bishop to say anything else, he said to him: ‘Today you shall celebrate the eucharist’. When he stood at the holy altar with the pope beside him and the deacons in a circle around the altar, the bishop began the prayer of conse- eration; but before adding the conclusion, he began the prayer of consecration al] over again for a second, a third, and a fourth time. Everybody was astonished at such repetition and the pope said to him: ‘What is this then, that you are starting the holy prayer for a fourth time and do not bring it to a conclusion?’ Then the bishop replied: ‘Forgive me, holy pope, but I do not perceive the coming of the Holy Ghost epiphoitésis as is usually the case; that is why I do not conclude the prayer. However, my sacred lord, would you send that deacon holding the fan rhipidion away from the altar, for I do not dare to tell him to go.’ Then the godly Agapetos gave the order and the deacon went away.

As he could not persuade the bishop to say anything else, he said to him: ‘Today you shall celebrate the eucharist’. When he stood at the holy altar with the pope beside him and the deacons in a circle around the altar, the bishop began the prayer of conse- eration; but before adding the conclusion, he began the prayer of consecration al] over again for a second, a third, and a fourth time. Everybody was astonished at such repetition and the pope said to him: ‘What is this then, that you are starting the holy prayer for a fourth time and do not bring it to a conclusion?’ Then the bishop replied: ‘Forgive me, holy pope, but I do not perceive the coming of the Holy Ghost epiphoitésis as is usually the case; that is why I do not conclude the prayer. However, my sacred lord, would you send that deacon holding the fan rhipidion away from the altar, for I do not dare to tell him to go.’ Then the godly Agapetos gave the order and the deacon went away. Straightaway the bishop and the pope saw the presence parousia of the Holy Ghost; but the curtain which was above the altar moved of its own volition and  \\n \\novershadowed the pope, the bishop, all the deacons who were in attendance and even the holy altar itself, for three hours. Then the godly Agapetos realised that this was a great bishop who had been falsely accused. And so great was his distress at having wronged him that he resolved never again to make any hasty decision, but to act with much thought and great patience. \\n&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^1:&quot;,257,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^K&quot;,485,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,3064],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^16&quot;,485,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^12&quot;,485,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^11&quot;,485,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^=&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1529,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390c-b22e-4f5b-9c59-adebc184884c&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^1F&quot;,&quot;&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^R&quot;,[],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^1G&quot;,[&quot;^1E&quot;,[]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^Z&quot;,&quot;[[Thoughts]]&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^1:&quot;,258,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^V&quot;,&quot;^1H&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^K&quot;,543,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^W&quot;,1,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^T&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1I&quot;,[],&quot;^1J&quot;,[],&quot;^1K&quot;,0,&quot;^1L&quot;,15],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^16&quot;,543,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^12&quot;,543,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^11&quot;,543,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^11&quot;,641,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^L&quot;,641,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^Y&quot;,[[&quot;Link&quot;,[&quot;^ &quot;,&quot;^1O&quot;,[&quot;Page_ref&quot;,&quot;Thoughts&quot;],&quot;^1P&quot;,[[&quot;Plain&quot;,&quot;&quot;]],&quot;^1Q&quot;,&quot;[[Thoughts]]&quot;,&quot;^1R&quot;,&quot;&quot;]]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^1B&quot;,true,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1530,&quot;^?&quot;,&quot;~u60ef390c-d683-4dce-872e-7aec1144382d&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1531,&quot;^1F&quot;,&quot;-e2--80--9c-We_decree_that_from_now_on_the_image_of_the_Lord_Sabaoth_will_no_longer_be_painted_according_to_senseless_and_unsuitable_imaginings-2c-_for_no_one_has_ever_seen_the_Lord_Sabaoth_(that_is-2c-_God_the_Father)_in_the_flesh-2e-_Only_Christ_was_seen_in_the_flesh-2c-_and_in_this_way_He_is_portrayed-2c-_that_is-2c-_in_the_flesh_and_not_according_to_His_divinity-2e-_Likewise-2c-_the_most_Holy_Mother_of_God_and_other_Saints_of_God-e2--80--a6-&quot;,536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1531,&quot;^R&quot;,[],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1531,&quot;^1G&quot;,[&quot;^1E&quot;,[]],536870917]],[&quot;^1@&quot;,[1531,&quot;^Z&quot;,&quot;“We decree that from now on the image of the Lord Sabaoth will no longer be painted according to senseless and unsuitable imaginings, for no one has ever seen the Lord Sabaoth (that is, God the Father) in the flesh.

When, after two years, the gold had still not been returned (for the farmer did not have the wherewithal to pay), Abba John sent for his and said: ‘Give me the piece of gold, brother’. He answered: ‘As God knows well, I do not have it.’ ‘Then I have found a way in which you can repay me for it’, was the elder’s reply. The farmer, thinking that he was to be given some task to perform, said: ‘Tell me, and I will do it’. Then Abba John said: ‘When you have time to spare and no work to do, come and make thirty prostrations and I will pay you one keration’, and he gave the man something to eat and drink. So it was agreed with the man that, when he was free to do so, he would come, and when he had performed his prostrations, the elder would give him his reward, that is, one eration, He also gave him something to eat and drink and hard-tack enough for the five persons of his household.

His task was to put the loaves in the oven, After three years he fell ill and eventually went to the Lord.

The godly elder John the Eunuch assured us (for he said he was present when they took the brother out of the water) that when the doctor measured the water, he found it to have been reduced by one measure.
